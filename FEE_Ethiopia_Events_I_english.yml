zemene_mesafint.1.d: "In the 18th century, the Empire of Ethiopia went through a period of numerous conflicts within its own borders Having defeated it's rivals, the Empire was helpless against factions led by various princes of the realm as each sought to fight each other for power while the Emperor increasingly had little authority outside the capital. \nThe development of both culture and society stagnated during this period; additionally, it was time of increased religious strife both within the Coptic Orthodox Ethiopian Church as well as between Chrstians and Muslims in the realm."
zemene_mesafint.1.a: "We must preserve the empire!"
zemene_mesafint.2.t: "Princes Demand the Right to Rule"
zemene_mesafint.2.d: "Even at the worst, the ruling dynasty of Ethiopia maintained a near-legendary status, being chosen directly by God in the minds of both commoner and noble. While the integrity of the dynasty was never questioned, many of the local princes claimed divine ordination in their own right, and were willing to seize such right to rule by force during this period."
zemene_mesafint.2.a: "Crush them!"
zemene_mesafint.2.b: "Attempt Negotiations"
zemene_mesafint.2.c: "Give in to their demands"
zemene_mesafint.3.t: "Succession Crisis"
zemene_mesafint.3.d: "While none seriously questioned the right of the ruling dynasty to rule, Ethiopia's complex succession system was prey to there being numerous contenders from within the same royal house. In a period of instability, noble factions often supported one contender over another with the implicit promise, that, once in power, they would be favorites."
zemene_mesafint.3.a: "How dare they?"
zemene_mesafint.4.t: "Rise of Empress Mentewab"
zemene_mesafint.4.d: "Faced with the lack of imperial authority, the Queen Mother of the latest Emperor has risen to prominence in [CAPITAL]. In an unprecedented move, she has requested the Patriarch to be crowned Empress to ensure the continuing stability of the empire. Historically, Mentewab was the first female ruler of Ethiopia's long history, and an able ruler who helped Ethiopia recover from years of decline."
zemene_mesafint.4.a: "Crown her Itege at once!"
zemene_mesafint.4.b: "Refuse this upstart!"
zemene_mesafint.5.t: "Regional Conflicts"
zemene_mesafint.5.d: "As centralized authority continues to decay, the diverse nationalities that make up the empire have become increasingly disloyal. Areas that have accepted imperial rule for centuries are now seeking to claim their own independence…"
zemene_mesafint.5.a: "A minor inconvenience…"
zemene_mesafint.6.t: "Monarch Assasinated!"
zemene_mesafint.6.d: "In a stunning turn of events that rocked not only the capital but sent shock-waves throughout East Africa, the Negusa Nagast was brutally killed in the palace today. Prior to this period of conflict, this was unheard of in the empire. News of the first killings, indeed, sparked a national outcry that anyone would raise a hand against the Lord's Annointed. Now, however, with different factions vying for the throne this only opens the floodgates to further killings and unrest."
zemene_mesafint.6.a: "Dark Times are ahead of us"
zemene_mesafint.7.t: "The End of Absolute Monarchy?"
zemene_mesafint.7.d: "With their belief that the Negusa Nagast was God's Chosen, it was only natural that the European philosophy of absolutism found open ears in Ethiopia. However, this theory seems increasingly unworkable during the current conflict."
zemene_mesafint.7.a: "The Age of Kings is over…"
zemene_mesafint.7.b: "I am the Senate!"
zemene_mesafint.8.t: "Rise of the Wara Sheh Dynasty"
zemene_mesafint.8.d: "While none aspired to seize the formal title of Emperor, there were families who wished to rule in all but name. One of the more prominent from the province of Yejju was the Wara Sheh. Due to their influence wielded in Ethiopia for a period of over 70 years, they are often called the Wara Sheh dynasty."
zemene_mesafint.8.a: "Accept their rule and influence"
zemene_mesafint.8.b: "Crush these upstarts!"
zemene_mesafint.9.t: "The End of an Era"
zemene_mesafint.9.d: "At long last, the Era of the Princes is over. A new and reformed monarchy is back in power, and Ethiopia can finally enter the modern age and leave behind its inner struggles."
zemene_mesafint.9.a: "Let us rebuild this land…"
