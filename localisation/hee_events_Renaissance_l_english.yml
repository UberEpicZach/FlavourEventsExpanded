 hee_renaissance.1.t:0 "The Italian Renaissance"
 hee_renaissance.1.d:0 "Over the course of a century, intellectual life on the Italian peninsula has seen stronger and stronger influences from the knowledge rediscovered in the ancients, Greek and Roman writers, philosophers, and orators, from Plato to Cicero. This development has largely happened in the interest of the public good, that a well-educated populace might better safeguard our civilisation than one could in the barbaric Middle Ages separating us from those glorious times. \nThese principles have become pervasive in our society, and carries influence not just in philosophy and humanist teachings, but in art and architecture, law and warfare. \nOver time, this will make our nation strong and our people indomitable, in the realm of the temporal as well as the spiritual."
 hee_renaissance.1.a:0 "As $COUNTRY$ looks to the past, $COUNTRY$ looks to the future."
 hee_renaissance.1.tt:0 "The blossoming of the Renaissance will be felt over time."
 hee_renaissance.2.t:0 "Renaissance Influences in $COUNTRY$"
 hee_renaissance.2.d:0 "Spreading from Italy and across Europe, the cultural \"rebirth\" of the ancient Greeks and Romans brings with it new ways of thinking about the world we live in. They give us a new understanding of how we relate to other people, in ways that changes politics as much as it changes art. While encompassing a multitude of cultural movements, expressed in a multitude of ways in different places, there are a few cire tenets bringing continuity to our cultural age. \nThese principles have become pervasive in our society, and carries influence not just in philosophy and humanist teachings, but in art and architecture, law and warfare. \nOver time, this will make our nation strong and our people indomitable, in the realm of the temporal as well as the spiritual."
 hee_renaissance.2.a:0 "As $COUNTRY$ looks to the past, $COUNTRY$ looks to the future."
 hee_renaissance.3.t:0 "End of Renaissance Culture"
 hee_renaissance.3.d:0 "As there was no moment that marked the beginning, there is no moment to mark the end. No great event, no grand last stand. As the principles guiding art and philosophy for the last century or more fades in relevance, there is no one to take notice. The Renaissance has not ended, it has merely developed into something else, with its own distinct ideas and worldviews. \nAnd as the Renaissance looked back to the ancients, who knows what will rise when we in the future look back to the Renaissance."
 hee_renaissance.3.a:0 "A new age has dawned, as quietly as the turning of the Earth."

 hee_renaissance.4.c:0 "Barracks in the modern style"
 hee_renaissance.5.t:0 "Large Renaissance Library"
 hee_renaissance.5.d:0 "With the \"rediscovery\" of the classics, there has been a shift in the focus of personal collections. No longer restrained to the dusty cellars of monasteries, ancient texts as well as more modern writings on similar subjects are finding their way to manors and palaces across our country. \nNow one of those personal collections has been opened to any who has sufficient reason to ask for an invitation."
 hee_renaissance.5.a:0 "Knowledge begets knowledge"
 hee_renaissance.6.t:0 "Renaissance Cartographer"
 hee_renaissance.6.d:0 "With our ever-expanding knowledge of the world, it has become apparent that earlier cartographers and their maps are not quite as accurate as previously thought. Thankfully those dark days are behind us, as evidenced by the return of a cartographer from his grand journey. He has presented to the [Monarch.GetTitle] sketches for new maps, infintely more accurate and useful than the ones of old. And if there are areas he is unsure about, he will actually write it on the map."
 hee_renaissance.6.a:0 "Wow, I never knew India was such a short way across the Atlantic."
 hee_renaissance.7.t:0 "Military Manual Written in the Vernacular"
 hee_renaissance.7.d:0 "One of our officers has, with the help of several scribes, compiled a manual of the collected knowledge about warfare found in our army. The tome covers fighting styles, tactics and histories of significant battles, and unlike previous books of its kind this one has been written in the [Country.GetAdjective] language rather than Latin! \nThis will make it much easier to train officers and soldiers alike."
 hee_renaissance.7.a:0 "That's how you're supposed to wield a sword?"
 hee_renaissance.8.t:0 "National Writer Produces Renaissance Masterpiece"
 hee_renaissance.8.d:0 "A few years ago, a writer from one of our provinces published a work of fiction, and in readings and performances it has truly resonated with the audience. Now it is becoming apparent that the work is not only popular at home, but abroad as well, with people in neighboring countries admiring the craftmanship and creativity at display. \nThis high-profile work has in its short existence already become a part of our growing national identity."
 hee_renaissance.8.a:0 "But is it better than Fabula Crepusculo?"
 hee_renaissance.9.t:0 "A Renaissance Genius"
 hee_renaissance.9.d:0 "A man in $CAPITAL$ has become notable for his brilliance in any subject he turns his mind to. Not only does he produce beautiful paintings and sculptures both, but he writes political treatises, elaborates on philosophical conundrums, and stands unparallelled in his understanding of the biology of animals as well as humans! \nBeing a loyal citizen of $COUNTRY$, he could certainly be convinced to serve the state, with the right incentive."
 hee_renaissance.9.a:0 "Pay him to improve the infrastructure in $CAPITAL$."
 hee_renaissance.9.b:0 "Ask him to better the state of river transportation."
 hee_renaissance.9.c:0 "Conscript him in the army and have him build great war machines!"

 hee_renaissance.10.t:0 "Renaissance Writer Produces Theological Treatise"
 hee_renaissance.10.d:0 "A writer in our country has presented his most recent work, this time on the Catholic church and his holiness the Pope. It is a thorough, thoughtful and extraordinarily well-argued piece, and anyone who reads it and actually understands what it says has to agree with even the finer points. \nHow can we best use this treatise?"
 hee_renaissance.10.a:0 "The Pope will understand this praise of the Curia."
 hee_renaissance.10.b:0 "The entire world will read this searing critique of the Pope."
 hee_renaissance.11.t:0 "Ancient Claim Revealed as False!"
 hee_renaissance.11.d:0 "A humanist scholar of the recent field of philology has studied the ancient document that was discovered last year, the one about our everlasting right to certain lands not currently within our borders. While the document was - absolutely rightfully - assumed to be centuries if not a millenia old, the scholar claims that the Latin used in the document doesn't match the Latin used at the time of the Romans or Charlemagne or whoever were supposed to have written it again. As a matter of fact, it uses words that were not common until the last decade. \nThis casts doubts on our claim, but at least we can be thankful he didn't get to the document before the ink was dry."
 hee_renaissance.11.a:0 "Pay him off to retract his claims!"
 hee_renaissance.11.b:0 "We must do the honorable thing and abandon our claim."
 hee_renaissance.11.c:0 "Then maybe he claims this document is false as well? And this?!"
 hee_renaissance.12.t:0 "Papal Legate Concedes to Leading Humanist"
 hee_renaissance.12.d:0 "In a discussion at a tribunal arranged by the Pope, the Papal legate in the end acknowledged the arguments of a prominent humanist. While the humanist had been accused of heresy, the Pope will now lift the accusation, acknowledging that at least his legates are not infallible."
 hee_renaissance.12.a:0 "This could only have happened in our forward-thinking [Root.GovernmentName]!"
 hee_renaissance.12.b:0 "The humanist should advise us at court."
 hee_renaissance.13.t:0 "Construction Running Over Budget"
 hee_renaissance.13.d:0 "The architect had presented the most beautiful plans. The stonemason had cut the most beautiful stone. The workers had asked for the most beautiful price. Alas, now it turns out that the marvel of modern engineering we were constructing was a marvel for a reason. Plans have had to be changed, more material is needed, and the entire construction takes longer than expected. With the project running out of money, something has to be done if we want more than a huge pile of rubble in the center of $CAPITAL$."
 hee_renaissance.13.a:0 "Let us increase the budget, simple as that."
 hee_renaissance.13.b:0 "It can still be done if we reorganise the project."
 hee_renaissance.14.t:0 "Iconic Renaissance Building"
 hee_renaissance.14.d:0 "In $PROVINCE$ there stands a beautiful Renaissance building, constructed centuries ago by our ingenious forebears.
