 FEE_Malwa_Events.1.T: "The Khalji Dynasty"
 FEE_Malwa_Events.1.D: "The Khaljis, of Turko-Afghan origin, traced their lineage back to the Turkic people known as the Khalaj. These ancestors migrated alongside the Hunas and Hephthalites from Central Asia into the southern and eastern regions of modern-day Afghanistan as early as 660 CE. There, they ruled the region of Kabul as the Buddhist Turk Shahis, gradually adopting many Afghan customs and traditions over time. The Khaljis' integration into Afghan society was so profound that they were regarded as Afghans by the Turkic nobles of the Delhi Sultanate. This cultural assimilation played a crucial role during the Khalji Revolution, when Jalal-ud-din Khalji ascended to the throne of Delhi. His rise was met with resistance from the Turkic nobles, who viewed him as an outsider due to his Afghan affiliations. Despite this opposition, the Khalji dynasty established itself as a formidable power in Delhi, overthrowing the Mamluk Slave Dynasty. Their rule was marked by significant military conquests and administrative reforms, but it was also fraught with internal strife and challenges to their legitimacy. Eventually, the dynasty was overthrown by the Tughlaq dynasty, and the Khaljis were exiled to the governorship of Malwa. As the Tughlaq dynasty began to deteriorate, the political landscape of India fractured. The Khaljis, along with the sultans of Gujarat, Jaunpur, Bengal, and the Bahmanis, declared their independence. Though they were now rulers of a smaller dominion, the Khaljis never forgot their origins as the original Delhi imperial dynasty that had overthrown the Mamluks. In Malwa, the Khalji rulers kept the flame of their imperial aspirations alive. They vowed to one day reclaim their lost imperial seat and crown in the Red City of Delhi. This ambition became a defining feature of their rule, driving their political and military strategies as they sought to restore their former glory."

 FEE_Malwa_Events.2.T: "The Fateful Oath"
 FEE_Malwa_Events.2.D: "One hundred and fifty years ago, our ancestor, a master of words whose tongue held great power over hearts when he would use it, made a speech that ever was remembered among our people. Fierce and fell were his words, and filled with anger and pride; and hearing them, our people were stirred to madness. Then, he swore a terrible oath. His seven sons lept straightway to his side and took the selfsame vow together, and red as blood shone their drawn swords in the glare of the torches. They swore an oath which none shall break, which none should take, by the name even of Allah, calling everlasting darkness upon themselves should they keep it not, and Muhammad they named as a witness, vowing to pursue those to the ends of the world, be they man or spirit, who should hold or take their ancestral lands from their possession. \nThe true doom of this oath has now been laid bare, and its folly revealed to us in a blinding flash. For nothing has it done, save sow division, kingslaying, and needless bloodshed among our people. By this oath, we cast ourselves into darkness, and none now may save us from this doom."
