 FEE_Kotte_Events.1.T: "The Legend of Sigiriya"
 FEE_Kotte_Events.1.D: "In the year of the Buddha in 1988, the king of Kotte, [Root.Monarch.GetName], set out from his palace to enjoy the beauty of his realm. He passed through fertile fields, fragrant gardens, and prosperous villages. He reached the foot of the towering rock of Sigiriya, where the ruins of a magnificent palace were visible. He asked his monks to tell him the history of this place. \nThe monks told him that Sigiriya was the ancient city where King Kashyapa had once ruled. Kashyapa had usurped the throne from his brother Moggallana and had moved his capital to Sigiriya. He had built a splendid palace on the top of the rock, but his glory was short-lived. Moggallana returned with an army to reclaim his throne, and Kashyapa took his own life. Moggallana cremated his brother's body with honour and took possession of Sigiriya. He stripped it of its treasures and gave it to the Buddhist monks as a monastery. He restored the capital to Anuradhapura and ruled with wisdom and compassion. \nThe monks then told the king of Kotte a marvellous secret, which had been preserved in their lineage for generations. They said that Moggallana, the rightful heir of Dhatusena, was the ancestor of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the king of Kotte. They showed him a genealogy, written on a palm leaf, which traced his lineage from Moggallana to Vijayabahu I, who had liberated Lanka from the Chola invaders to Parakramabahu I, who had unified the island under one rule, to [Root.Monarch.GetName], who had conquered Jaffna and established his supremacy over the whole of Lanka."

 FEE_Kotte_Events.2.T: "The Epic of Sigiriya"
 FEE_Kotte_Events.2.D: "I wandered into the woods, and saw a wonder, \nA rock that rose like a flame in the sky, \nA city that shone like a star on its peak, \nA lion that roared at its entrance. \n\nI climbed the stairs, and beheld a beauty, \nA palace that dazzled with gold and gems, \nA gallery that displayed the finest paintings, \nA mirror that reflected my face. \n\nI asked the monks, and learned a mystery, \nA tale that told of my ancient lineage, \nA history that revealed my royal origin, \nA genealogy that confirmed my claim. \n\nThis was the gift of Moggallana, the rightful, \nWho avenged his father, and reclaimed the throne, \nWho spared his brother, and gave him a funeral, \nWho ruled with wisdom, and endowed the monks. \n\nThis is the sign of Parakramabahu, the glorious, \nWho honours his ancestor, and praises his name, \nWho restores his city, and preserves his culture, \nWho reigns with justice, and blesses his people."

 FEE_Kotte_Events.3.T: "A false Dynasty"
 FEE_Kotte_Events.3.D: "The Kotte dynasty’s fake connection to King Moggallana was exposed, causing outrage among the Sinhalese Buddhists. The other kingdoms condemned the Kotte court for lying and disrespecting their history. The Kotte kingdom faced a crisis of legitimacy and trust, both from their neighbours and their people. They had betrayed their shared heritage and their subjects. The people, already burdened by the Kotte rule, now felt cheated by their leadership."
