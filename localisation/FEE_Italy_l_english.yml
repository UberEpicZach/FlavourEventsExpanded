 FEE_Italy_Events.1.T: "The Wars of Italy"
 FEE_Italy_Events.1.D: "The Italian peninsula of the Middle Ages was divided between the fragmented north, split into numerous fiefs and city-states under the nominal sovereignty of the Holy Roman Emperor, the Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples in the south, and the Papal State that had jurisdiction over parts of central Italy. The fourteenth century was a period of consolidation for the biggest powers of Italy, especially for Milan, Venice, Florence, and the Pope, who expanded their dominions over the smaller cities. The friction that arose from these expansions continued into the next century and culminated with the Lombard Wars between Milan and Venice. Following the signing of the Peace of Lodi in 1454, a balance emerged between the five regional powers: the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Venice, the Papal State, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Republic of Florence. A mutual defence pact, the Italian League, was formed between them and the four decades that followed were characterized by diplomatic and military balance, overseen by Lorenzo de' Medici. Conflicts were kept small and regionalized, while the Renaissance was flourishing in all Italian centers of culture. This balance was however broken in the last decade of the century, following the death of the Florentine statesman. The spark for the First Italian War was the dynastic succession of the duchy of Milan. \nThe many wars that shaped the Italian peninsula from 1494 on saw the introduction of many significant advances in military technology and tactics, including field artillery, muskets, and combined tactics."

 FEE_Italy_Events.2.T: "Improve the Infantry"
 FEE_Italy_Events.2.D: "The infantry saw profound evolutions during the Italian wars, transforming from a predominantly armed force with pikes and halberds to a more flexible arrangement of arquebusiers, pikemen and other specialties. While the first part of the wars saw the prevalence of Swiss mercenaries and lansquenets, groups with firearms established themselves from 16th century. \n\nIn 1503, a skirmish between French and Spanish forces represented the first demonstration of the usefulness of arquebuses in battle. The Spanish general Gonzalo de Codoba feigned a retreat, attracting a contingent of men-at-arms between two groups of his arquebusiers. As the French army found themselves among the shooters, volleys of bullets hit them hard in both flanks. Before the French could attack the vulnerable arquebusiers, a Spanish cavalry charge broke the French forces and forced them to retreat. While the French army was in rout, the Spanish enemies inflicted heavy losses on it. \n\nThe success of the use of firearms in the Italian wars led Niccolò Machiavelli, often described as an enemy of the use of the arquebuses, to write in his treatise On the art of war that all citizens of a city should know how to shoot with a pistol."

 FEE_Italy_Events.3.T: "Cavalry, to Charge!"
 FEE_Italy_Events.3.D: "Heavy cavalry - the latest evolution of medieval armored knights - remained the protagonist in the battlefields of the Italian wars. The French gendarmes generally proved to be the most effective against the horse troops of the other states, mainly because of the excellent horses in their possession. The Spaniards used a type of cavalry called Jinete in their sorties."

 FEE_Italy_Events.4.T: "Artillery must be prefectioned"
 FEE_Italy_Events.4.D: "The Italian wars saw artillery, especially field artillery, take on an indispensable role in any first-rate army. Charles VIII, during his invasion of Italy, brought with him a truly mobile siege procession, consisting of culverins and bombards mounted on wheeled trolleys, which could be deployed against an enemy fortress immediately upon arrival. The French siege arsenal brought with it several technological innovations. Charles's army used horses to pull cannons rather than the oxen typically used up to that time. Furthermore, French cannons, forged in the same methods used to produce bronze bells, boasted a previously unknown lightness and mobility. The most important improvement of the French however was the creation of iron cannonballs. Before the Italian wars, artillery fired stone balls that often shattered upon impact. The invention of water mills allowed the operation of furnaces with a temperature sufficient to melt the iron in order to make cannon balls. With this technology, Charles's army could conquer, within a few hours, walls and castles that had previously resisted sieges for months or even years. \n\nThe armies of the Italian wars were led by a great variety of commanders, from mercenaries to noble leaders up to the king himself."

 FEE_Italy_Events.5.T: "We will be safe behind our Forts"
 FEE_Italy_Events.5.D: "Most of the fighting that took place during the Italian wars took place during the sieges. That of the first descent of Charles VIII in Italy is traditionally considered the initial date of the development of the fortification to the modern, which will lead to the birth of increasingly complex fortified systems during the subsequent invasions. The army of Charles VIII in fact had a modern artillery in front of which many antiquated medieval castles had to succumb. These systems will soon spread throughout Europe, initially by Italian engineers."
