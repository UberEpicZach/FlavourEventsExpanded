 foi.eventdesc1:0 "At last the Great Schism between the Western Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church has been mended. Withe the spread of our orthodoxy and the reunification of the pentarchy, including the vital episcopal see of Rome, the other heretic faiths now hold little sway over the people. There will be those that still cling to these old ways, but they will be few in number and the Pentarchy can once more claim universal rule over all of Christendom."

 foi.eventdesc2:0 "Ever sicnce the Great Schism in the 11th century, Chirstendom has been broken into two major parts: the Orthodox east and the Catholic west. But now, with the recent reunification of the Pentarchy and the mending of the two sides, we must make an important decision: either agree to join in Christendom's newfound unity or retain our old ways. What shall we do?"

 foi.eventdesc3:0 "Our mighty Tengri nation has always tolerated our subjects who do not follow our ways and always let them believe in what gods they wished. But now, we have heard that Christendom has united, bringing with it many changes to how their churches are structured. Our subjects want us to implement these new changes in our country. What shall we do?"
 foi.event3opt1:0 "Let them worship what they want!"
 foi.event3opt2:0 "We can't afford these changes!"
 foi.eventname4:0 "Persian Shiism?"
 foi.eventdesc4:0 "Ever since we converted to Shiism, there has been great unrest in our nation seeing as most of our people are not followers of our established religion. It would be wise to return to the faith of our fathers."
 foi.event4opt1:0 "We can never turn our backs to Allah!"
 foi.event4opt2:0 "I didn't like this new religion anyways."
 foi.eventname5:0 "The One True God?"
 foi.eventdesc5:0 "For a while now, there have been those in our lands that follow this strange religion that claims there is only one god. Recently, however, their followers have greatly increased in numbers and our country now stands at a crossroad: Either we accept this new strange religion, which will surely upset our neighbours, or we supress them, which is sure to cause great uproar in our country."
 foi.event5opt1:0 "I couldn't keep track of all these gods anyways!"

What has begun as a situational and interested political bound have evolve in a close economic, political and military synergy. With our ruler still unmarried and the ruler of Occitania also unmarried, the fraternal spirit of our peoples to each other is acclaimed all over Europe, our nobility have fused into one, and with no one to object it, then perhaps it is time to erase our lasts boundarys to maybe form in a near future a greater entity to rule us all."

 foi.eventname8:0 "Change of Administration"
 foi.eventdesc8:0 "Having abandoned the religion of our ancestors we are also changing some of our administrative customs. Rather than relying on the Zoroastrian establishment for legitimacy all power now comes from the Monarch and the circle around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] instead."
 foi.event8opt1:0 "Ok."
 foi.eventname9:0 "The Sons of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 foi.eventdesc9:0 "The founder of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty was a caring father who equally loved his five sons. He loved them so much that he couldn't resign himself to choose an official heir between them; even on his deathbed, where the five sons supplicated him to choose a successor. Instead, he implored his sons not to fight each other after he passed away but rather designate the next Shah between themselves. They honourned their father's request and finally came to an agreement and chose the youngest brother. From then on, every successor has continued this tradition and each one of the brothers left behind a distinct lineage. When the time comes to choose an official heir to the empire, the five branches of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family assemble and a general vote is done to determine which lineage should provide the next official heir. To provide security in this system from unrestricted ambitions and from power-hungry members, the second [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] shah created a special force whose loyalty is only to the actual ruler and act to maintain the status quo between the lineages. But now, the time as come: the five lineages have assemble and after long deliberation, the official successor of the Shah is from..."

 foi.eventname10:0 "Gifted and Ambitious"
 foi.eventdesc10:0 "The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family is one of the cornerstones of the empire. Everyone in the family is educated in the matters of the state and are assigned where they can shine the most: whether it be in the navy, the army, in administration, in the diplomatic corps or even as a satrap. This assures a relatively loyal and efficient base on which the shah can rely on. But lately, one member in particular has distinguished himself as one of our satraps. Because of his outstanding rule over the satrapy, there have been wispers among his followers wondering why he was not made our official heir. They might be whispers for now, but it would be foolish to stand in the way of such a talent."
 foi.event10opt1:0 "Appoint him as our new prime minister."
 foi.event10opt2:0 "To Hell with tradition, this man shall be my heir!"
 foi.eventname11:0 "Assassination!"
 foi.eventdesc11:0 "Even if the official successor of the shah was elected by a majority vote by the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family, it doesn't mean that every transition was peaceful. Jealousy, ambition and grief is also haunting us, and today our heir just payed the price. We have suspicions but no proof for now... What should be our next move?"

 foi.eventdesc12:0 "When ambition could not be satisfied within our system, temptation of seditionn can become very attractive. One such member of our dynasty has risen up in a futile effort to 'reclaim his legitimate place'."

 foi.eventdesc13:0 "For centuries now, Zoroastrianism has seen a gradual decline. Ever since the missionaries from the west started to arrive in our lands, more and more of our people have turned to this new faith. We have always been a very tolerant regime, but with the recent sharp decline of our religion has created resentment in some of our more conservative officials. Now we crossed a threshold where we must make a decision: should we abandon the faith of our ancestors a begin a new relationship with the West, or hold steadfast to our faith, but risk rebellion from our people? (You will loose Persian Government to just a normal monarchy should you switch.)"
