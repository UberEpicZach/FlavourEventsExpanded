 wotd_dodo_events.1.d:0 "When exploring the island of we stumbled upon this odd creature. The bird doesn't seem all to bothered by our presence, rather it seems interested in our helmets and other shiny accessories, doing everything in its might to get a hold of them. With its size being roughly twice that of a swan, but also twice as heavy, it seemingly lacks the ability of flight. Which might be fine, as it doesn't seem to be sharing the island with any predators."

 wotd_dodo_events.1.b:0 "Take some specimens back home."

 wotd_dodo_events.2.d:0 "It has been more than a century since we first set foot on the island of [dodoprovince.GetName], where we had the pleasure to get acquainted with this charismatic plumb bird. Since then the bird has been taken on tours across our royal academies and was praised for its lovey-dovey character. Even the children of our court for had a Mr. Dodo pet bird to accompany them.\n\nSadly, the bird, unknowingly, had seen its numbers decrease over these last decades. Until there were only a few elder birds left, who were unable to procreate. As such, the Dodo bird has now been declared extinct. All that we have left to remind us of their presence are some mounted and stuffed subjects displayed at our national university."
