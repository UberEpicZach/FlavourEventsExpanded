 wotd_naval_events.1.t: "Maoi of the Rapa Nui"
 wotd_naval_events.1.d: "When we first arrived on this solitary island to refill our water reserves we were greeted by a large community of tattooed islanders, many of which wearing a feathered headdress and clad in nothing more than a loincloth. Their previous leader had just died and the new Tangata Manu has taken control over the situation. Before he can become the gold-like leader of his birdman cult he first has to erect the statue of his predecessor. These large monoliths, in their language called Moai, are hauled to their altars through herculean feats of strength, using nothing but human muscles and rope. \nApparently, we arrived on an auspicious occasion. As all those who arrived on this island saw their lives cut short, and these islanders apparently practice a form of ritualistic cannibalism. \nWe should probably get on moving before the festivities end."
