 FEE_Venice_Events.1.T: "The Venetian Fleet"
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.D: "A new phase for the Venetian navy began in 1453, with the fall of Constantinople and the start of the centuries-old confrontation with the Turks. Faced with the growing threat to its maritime possessions, we are faced with the choice of constituting a real permanent naval navy, with dozens of galleys operating in peacetime and an appreciable force of more than one hundred galleys in the event of war."
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.OPT1: "We must create a new mercantile fleet."
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.OPT2: "Galleys are safer."
 FEE_Venice_Events.1.OPT3: "We can't afford either right now."

 FEE_Venice_Events.2.T: "Magistrato alla Milizia da Mar"
 FEE_Venice_Events.2.D: "The maintenance and administration of such a naval force required an intense organizational effort, which was delegated to a new magistracy in charge of the construction and maintenance of ships and artillery, of the procurement of the biscuit and general of food, weapons and gunpowder, the recruitment of crews and the supply of money. "
 FEE_Venice_Events.2.OPT1: "Gloria a San Marco!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.3.T: "Naval Reform"
 FEE_Venice_Events.3.D: "At the same time, the spread of firearms gradually led to arming the galleys no longer with traditional Greek fire, but with artillery positioned at the bow and able to fire in the direction of the ship's advance. In the same period, new types of ships were developed: \n The brig, a small and fast ship, similar to a galley, for escort and transport services. About 20 m long and 3 m wide, for about 14 banks. \n The Galeotta, a small ship similar to a galley, but faster and more maneuverable. About 25 m long and 4 m wide, for about 15 banks. \n The Fusta, a small thin galley. About 35 m long and 5 m wide, for about 20 banks. \n The bastard galley, with larger dimensions and fuller stern shapes than the thin galley, capable of acting as a captain or patroness, that is, as a flagship."
 FEE_Venice_Events.3.OPT1: "Reforms will come."

 FEE_Venice_Events.4.T: "Governator de' Condannati"
 FEE_Venice_Events.4.D: "In the sixteenth century, the traditional small throwing weapons (bows and crossbows) were gradually replaced on board ships with more modern arquebuses. Also in the same period as the traditional free galleys, whose crews of convicts were composed of the so-called buonavoglia (i.e. free men recruited for pay) and zontaroli (i.e. debtors and convicts, who thus paid off their debt, or conscripts for the need for war), the first sforzate galleys began to join forces, that is, moved exclusively by convicts condemned to forced labor at the oars. The use of this type of ship, however, always remained rather limited in the Venetian navy, so much so that they did not even fall within the normal hierarchy of the fleet and constituted a separate flotilla, dependent on the so-called Governator de 'Condannati."
 FEE_Venice_Events.4.OPT1: "The Commander shall lead them."

 FEE_Venice_Events.5.T: "Porta di Terra"
 FEE_Venice_Events.5.D: "After the fall of Constantinople (1453) and the consequent threat posed by the Ottoman fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, the arsenal underwent important works of war strengthening and productive structures; to commemorate these works, the monumental Porta di Terra (Porta da Tera) or Porta Magna was erected. The portal, built between 1457 and 1460 on the model of the Roman triumphal arches, became the first example of Renaissance architecture in the city."
 FEE_Venice_Events.5.OPT1: "Marvelous!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.6.T: "Arsenal Expansion"
 FEE_Venice_Events.6.D: "Starting from 1473 and for a century until 1573, the third major phase of development of the arsenal took place, in which the last extensions were made by merging various surrounding marshy lands, with the construction of external residences for workers, public ovens and warehouses for cereals (the Darsena Nuovissima) and Galeazze, which led the arsenal to cover an area of almost 24 hectares."
 FEE_Venice_Events.6.OPT1: "Marble, Honour and Virtue."

 FEE_Venice_Events.7.T: "Espansione dell'Arsenale del 1535"
 FEE_Venice_Events.7.D: "through the appropriation of an area owned by the convent of Celestia, at the north-western end of the Arsenale Nuovissimo, placing the activities related to the gunpowder processing and storage; the area was connected to the Arsenale Vecchio, after having acquired other land from the same convent, which brought the already large area dedicated to dust from 5000 to 7800 m² overall. A new facade was erected for the Volto del Bucintoro, expanding the square to accommodate the ceremonial boat of the same name, rebuilt between 1525 and 1526. Later on, was built, close to the walls overlooking the Rio of San Daniele, the artillery workshop - a building about 180 m long, still existing - and the fifteenth-century arms rooms were renovated. The close collaboration between artillerymen, smelters and manufacturers of powders, inside and outside the arsenal, contributed to the affirmation of the Venetian war industry, at the forefront in Europe for almost two centuries, with the invention of lethal weapons such as shooting mortars curved, huge siege bombards, culverins, falcons and battle falconets. A decree of the Commission of Ten and the Superintendent of Artillery of 1565 explicitly refers to the presence of "artillery factories" distributed in various warehouses in the arsenal."
 FEE_Venice_Events.7.OPT1: "Marble, Honour and Virtue."

 FEE_Venice_Events.8.T: "Espansione Finale dell'Arsenale"
 FEE_Venice_Events.8.D: "Between 1566 and 1573 the last phase of resumption of the works was carried out in the Arsenale Nuovissimo, with new covered yards in the Isolotto and two large aquatic yards (\"water faces\") at the reeds or Gaggiandre; between 1566 and 1568 the tezon of sieghe and timber was built facing west, towards the Galeazze canal and next to the Novissimetta, where the Squadratori building is located, overlooking a small basin for the conservation of oak wood. In 1569 there was a powerful explosion of dust in the Celestia area, causing extensive damage to the walls, some building sites and the Celestia convent. A fifth extension dates back to the same period, with the excavation of the dock of the Galeazze, covering yards for the construction of this new type of battleship, which proved to be decisive for obtaining victory during the numerous naval battle.\n The construction of the small temple of the Madonna of the Arsenale leaning against the eastern tower of the Arsenale water gate; later on the architect Antonio da Ponte rebuilt the building of the Corderie; the monumental access portal to the arms rooms and to the artillery workshop that closes the Stradal de Campagna was built."
 FEE_Venice_Events.8.OPT1: "Our fleet will never be defeated."

 FEE_Venice_Events.9.T: "Fanti di Mar"
 FEE_Venice_Events.9.D: "The first example of Fanti da Mar is traced back to the time of the Fourth Crusade when the Doge Enrico Dandolo set up an ordered regiment on ten companies, distributed variously on the ships. This corps participated in the expedition that led to the conquest of Constantinople (1204). Only in 1550, however, these troops found a definitive arrangement and were called Fanti da Mar"

 FEE_Venice_Events.12.T: "The arrival of the Michele Attendolo"
 FEE_Venice_Events.12.D: "Gattamelata was succeeded by the leader Michele Attandolo, already in the service of the Republic of Florence against Milan. During his command the mercenary captain Scaramuccia da Forlì also operated under the Venetian insignia, distinguished in 1436 in the liberation of Brescia from the Visconti siege."
 FEE_Venice_Events.12.OPT1: "May he be blessed!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.13.T: "Jewish Community"
 FEE_Venice_Events.13.D: "With the battle of Agnadello numerous Jews from the hinterland (there were various communities between Vicenza and Conegliano) poured into the city to escape the abuses of the army of the League of Cambrai. In increasing numbers, they settled in all the Venetian districts, creating not a few frictions with the local population (often fomented by the Friars Minor). \n§YIf we allow them in§! new problems might arise if the other countries show intolerance with them"
 FEE_Venice_Events.13.OPT1: "They are our brothers."
 FEE_Venice_Events.13.OPT2: "Abandon them!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.14.T: "Ghetto Novo"
 FEE_Venice_Events.14.D: "On March 29, 1516, the government of the Serenissima (which would never have admitted an expulsion, given the economic importance of the community) put a hand to this situation by concentrating the Jews in the Ghetto Novo, an islet where a foundry once existed and which then housed a residential neighborhood. The inhabitants were then evicted to allow Jews to be imprisoned in a Ghetto. The only two entrances to the island, the bridges over the Rio di San Girolamo and the Rio del Ghetto, were closed at night and were guarded by Christian guardians, paid by the Jews themselves. \n The first inhabitants of the Ghetto Nuovo were the Jews of the Tokesca nation (Ashkenazi), which had the obligation to manage pawn shops. The Israelites were allowed few other professions: strazzarìa, or the second-hand trade, and medicine (doctors were allowed to leave the Ghetto at night to visit their patients)."
 FEE_Venice_Events.14.OPT1: "Erect the Ghetto."
 FEE_Venice_Events.14.OPT2: "Execute them."

 FEE_Venice_Events.15.T: "The Levantini Family"
 FEE_Venice_Events.15.D: "In 1541 the Serenissima granted the Ghetto Vecchio (a neighborhood adjacent to the Ghetto Novo) to the Levantini, a group made up of merchants from the Ottoman Empire. The Venetian economy certainly took advantage of this event, troubled by the wars against the Turks and by the increased competition from the port of Ancona. The Levantines had different obligations than the Germans: they did not deal with loans but were traders. This nation had decidedly particular habits: they exhibited sumptuous and oriental robes, with turbans and ornaments, decidedly contrasting with the modest German Jews."
 FEE_Venice_Events.15.OPT1: "You are welcome!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.16.T: "Il Ridotto"
 FEE_Venice_Events.16.D: "As the original European casino, Il Ridotto was a government-owned gambling house that formalized gambling and excessive money loss in Venice in 1638. It was established once the Great Council gave up on preventing people from playing for money during the Carnivale. Eventually, people from across Europe would come to Venice to test their luck and hopefully make a quick fortune. While the wing of the San Moisè Palace was supposedly open to the public, only nobles could afford the high stakes played there.\n\nWhile money flowed freely for more than a century, gambling was outlawed and Il Ridotto was closed in 1774."

 FEE_Venice_Events.17.D: "Son of Nicolò di Giovanni Foscari and Caterina di Giovanni Michiel, Franesco was of the Foscari family, one of the "Case Nuove", the patrician Venetian families which ascended during the Late Middle Age. In 1400 he joined the Quarantia, and the following year the judges of his own; in 1403 the Saviours to the Orders and then became Avogador. When Tomasso Mocenigo died on the 4th of April 1423 Francesco competed for the supreme magistracy against five other candidates, all more mature than himself, among whom Pietro Loredan excelled on the ballot. By exploiting his partisans within the electoral college, Foscari managed to bring his competitors into disrepute, all while Venice was at war with Milan in the Guerre di Lombardia."

 FEE_Venice_Events.18.T: "Bartolomeo Marcello"
 FEE_Venice_Events.18.D: "He was born in Venice in the second half of 1402, the eldest son of the patrician Benedetto di Bartolomeo and Maddalena di Bianco di Alvise da Riva. This branch of the family, which resided in the parish of S. Marina, was the most important of the household; he was orphaned of his father at a very early age, so he also had to take care of his younger brother Francesco. On 23 March 1437, he was one of the sages in the Ordini, which dealt with matters relating to the fleet and maritime trade."

 FEE_Venice_Events.20.D: "Francesco Foscari was able to give to the Lagoon Republic a territorial domain stretching from the river Isonzo to the Adda, prosperous and productive lands in which the Venetian Merchants could think of solid investments, less conspicuous, perhaps, but more secure than those of maritime trade"
 FEE_Venice_Events.20.OPT1: "Marvelous!"

 FEE_Venice_Events.21.T: "Treachery of Jacopo?"
 FEE_Venice_Events.21.D: "My son Jacopo, the only one that survived the Peste of 1430s has already been accused of treachery against the Republic when on 18 February 1445, the Council of Ten imprisoned him on the charge of colluding with foreign princes. Foscari, however, had managed to save himself by fleeing to Trieste. Two days later the Ten banished him from Venice in perpetuity, condemning him to exile in Nauplia. The super-command Marco Trevisan was then sent to Trieste to execute the sentence and on 3 March the Dogaressa was forbidden to travel to Julian city to visit her son. In fact, according to historical documents, it seems that the Council had acted with a certain mildness perhaps due to pressure from the doge and his family. The Trevisan left for Trieste no earlier than 25 February and in any case did not succeed in capturing the Foscari since on 11 March the doge was asked to induce his son to turn himself in. In the following months, the Dieci was substantially inert and only on 28 November 1446 was the confinement at Nauplia converted with that at Zelarino, a Venetian locality very close to the Lagoon of which the Foscari were feudal lords. Finally, on 13 September 1447, the Dieci granted a pardon. \n\nA today the Ten came back to deal with him: he was now accused of entertaining correspondence with Francesco Sforza and even Muhammad II. On 12 June, therefore, the super-committee Lorenzo Loredan was sent to Chania. He brought Foscari back to Venice where, on 24 July, the Council gave him the mildest sentence, i.e. confirmation of his Cretan exile. The doge and the young man's family were also allowed to visit him in prison."

 FEE_Venice_Events.22.T: "Death of Francesco Foscari"
 FEE_Venice_Events.22.D: "Francesco Foscari died a few days later, on 1 November (he had made his will on 29 October), at his home in Santa Margherita. A state funeral was arranged for him with an exhibition to the people in ducal vestments, despite the opposition of his widow, who saw it as a clumsy act of reparation by that power that had taken away her son and humiliated her husband. The body was accompanied by the new doge [Root.Monarch.GetName] who appeared in the simple guise of a senator. Francesco Foscari was buried in the presbytery of the basilica of the Frari, in the mausoleum made for him by Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino, in an urn supported by four graceful corbels adorned with the three theological virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) in whose arrangement around the sarcophagus Niccolò modified the conventional and static arrangement of the personifications, transforming it into a drama inserted in the flow of time. The crowning figure of the Saviour changed the common motif of the Risen Christ into the image of the Ascension of Christ taken from the Venetian duchy, as an allusion to the true ruler of Venice, to whom alone his representative - the doge - was responsible."
