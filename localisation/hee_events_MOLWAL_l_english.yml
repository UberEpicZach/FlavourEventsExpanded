 hee_MOL.1.t:0 "An Overlord"
 hee_MOL.1.d:0 "Threatened by giants on every border, Moldovia is too weak to exist without a protector. Thus, in the 15th and 16th centuries, different rulers struck deals with Poland, Hungary and the Ottomans to safeguard the princedom's existence. While we would have to accept the loss of some autonomy, the alternative might be that we are wiped from the map."
 hee_MOL.1.a:0 "We choose a northern alliance."
 hee_MOL.1.b:0 "With Hungary!"
 hee_MOL.1.c:0 "We must seek support from the Ottomans."
 hee_MOL.1.e:0 "We are masters of our own fate."
 hee_MOL.2.t:0 "Our Final Overlord"
 hee_MOL.2.d:0 "In 1526 Hungary began to collapse, and The Ottomans became the strongest presence in south-eastern Europe. In light of this new political climate, we need to look for a more permament protector."
 hee_MOL.2.a:0 "Poland forever!"
 hee_MOL.2.b:0 "We will help Hungary survive."
 hee_MOL.2.c:0 "The Turks are the new masters of Eastern Europe."
 hee_MOL.2.e:0 "Eternal freedom!"
 hee_MOL.5.t:0 "$FROM$ Comes to Us For Protection"
 hee_MOL.5.d:0 "Because of its precarious situation, $FROM$ has chosen to once again seek out a protector among its neighbors. While they are rumored to have been in talks with a number of their neighbors, they have decided to pay tribute to us. By our hereditary duty, they are now our vassal."
 hee_MOL.5.a:0 "We will keep their enemies at bay."
 hee_MOL.5.b:0 "Who do they think they are? Let their princedom rot."
 hee_MOL.6.t:0 "$FROM$ betrays $COUNTRY$!"
 hee_MOL.6.d:0 "The new [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of $FROM$ had agreed to maintain the agreement of the [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors, but has instead abandoned their feudal duties! They are now paying their tributes to another liege, and receiving their protection."
 hee_MOL.6.a:0 "This is an affront to all!"
 hee_MOL.7.t:0 "$FROM$ Seeks Protection Elsewhere"
 hee_MOL.7.d:0 "Because of its precarious situation, $FROM$ has chosen to yet again seek out a protector among its neighbors. However, instead of going with us, the natural choice, $FROM$ has chosen to pay tribute to a different liege."
 hee_MOL.7.a:0 "Let them keep that worthless princedom as a millstone around their neck."
 hee_MOL.9.t:0 "$FROM$ Pledges Itself to $COUNTRY$ For All Time!"
 hee_MOL.9.d:0 "With the breakdown of the Eastern European power balance, $COUNTRY$ sought a more permanent protector than it has in the past, and naturally they could find no better fit than us."
 hee_MOL.9.a:0 "$FROM$ will forever be under the protection of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 hee_MOL.9.b:0 "We cannot be responsible for their safety."
 hee_MOL.10.t:0 "Treasonous $FROM$!"
 hee_MOL.10.d:0 "In a diplomatic move of unbelievable audacity, $FROM$ has renounced their vows to our country, and instead sworn allegiance to another of their neighbors! What's worse, they have bound their princedom to them in eternal servitude."
 hee_MOL.10.a:0 "They deserve to be wiped off the earth!"
 hee_MOL.11.t:0 "$FROM$ Abandons Their Vows!"
 hee_MOL.11.d:0 "Despite everything we have done for the [From.GetAdjective]s, the newly crowned [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has refused to renew the vows of vassalage. Instead they have decided that they have the strength to stand alone in a world that wants them dead."
 hee_MOL.11.a:0 "They will not last long without us."
 hee_MOL.12.t:0 "$FROM$ Establishes Their Independence"
 hee_MOL.12.d:0 "While they have been vassals of other nations for nearly two centuries, shifting their alliegiance with the changing political terrain, $FROM$ has decided it is strong enough to stand on its own. The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has sworn that no other nations will ever rule the [From.GetAdjective]s again."
 hee_MOL.12.a:0 "Their [From.Monarch.GetTitle] is formidable, but a [From.Monarch.GetTitle] alone does not a [From.GovernmentName] make."
 hee_WAL.1.t:0 "An Overlord"
 hee_WAL.1.d:0 "Wallachia needs to have strong protector if it is to survive in these harsh times. That was why, throughout the 15th and 16th century, each hospodar chose an overlord from among their neighbours to prevent Wallachia from disappearing off the map."
 hee_WAL.1.a:0 "We are with the Poles"
 hee_WAL.1.b:0 "The Hungarians need our help."
 hee_WAL.1.c:0 "Long live Sulejmani!"
 hee_WAL.1.e:0 "We are the masters of our own fate."
 hee_WAL.2.t:0 "Our Final Overlord"
