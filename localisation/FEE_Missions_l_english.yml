 fee_yor_torquoise_throne_desc: "The Takht-i-Firoza, or the Turquoise Throne, stands as both a disgusting reminder to the Bahmani dominance over the Deccan and of Hindu complicity in the Turkish conquest. As long as the throne still stands at the centre of Gulbarga, no Reddy can rest easily. We shall launch a Westward expedition and topple the Shia Sultanate once and for all, lest we be forever shackled as subject to the Turk."

 fee_yor_treaties_virtue_desc: "Our scripture lays great emphasis on the importance of surrounding oneself with positive company. A king should strive to elevate only men of great calibre to important positions within his cabinet, lest he bring his domain to ruination itself. Our Raja, being of the highest honor, has heeded this advice well by allowing only the most talented minds to handle affairs of administration, diplomacy and the military. Such is evidence enough of the sincerity and longevity of the Kondaveedu Clan."

The greatest responsibility of the King is to protect his subjects, to cast aside his honor and principles if need be.

Yet, years of complacency have rotten the Empire to its very foundation. As the Empire enters an era of decay, it is clear that they can no longer claim to be the Defender of the Brahman!
