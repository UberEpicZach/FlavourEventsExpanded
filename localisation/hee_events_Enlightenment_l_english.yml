 hee_enlightenment.24.t:0 "Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment"
 hee_enlightenment.24.d:0 "Following conflict and bloodshed, as well as the development of new scientific and ideological practices, the authority of religion has been shaken, and the truth of the world no longer seems as simple as it once did. Humans know more now than we ever have before, and yet the only thing we are certain of is that there are so many answers yet to find. \nNevertheless, every year sees new discoveries and ideas, and philosophers are no longer just developing traditions, but ideas and worldviews.\n\nWith these developments happening in our country as well as across Europe, we have entered the Age of Enlightenment."
 hee_enlightenment.24.a:0 "These are the times we live in."
 hee_enlightenment.24.tt:0 "The developments of the Age of Enlightenment will be seen over time."
 hee_enlightenment.2.t:0 "Coffee House Gathering"
 hee_enlightenment.2.d:0 "A group of philosophers, scientists and \"thinkers\" have started regularly meeting in one of our capital's newly opened coffee houses. In addition to greatly benefiting local café business, their free exchange of thoughts brings new ideas to the fore, and occasionally acts as the source of a new breakthrough that people in the know assures us is ery exciting."
 hee_enlightenment.2.a:0 "Make sure they discuss the challenges facing $COUNTRY$."
 hee_enlightenment.2.b:0 "It does little harm to let them babble freely."
 hee_enlightenment.3.t:0 "Enlightened Absolutism"
 hee_enlightenment.3.d:0 "While many enlightenment thinkers are critical of monarchies, and many monarchs are suspicious of enlightened ideals, there are those who realise the enlightened path is the way of the future. Ideas developed by modern philosophers can aid our bureaucracy and lend even greater legitimacy to our absolute rule. On the other hand, some of them speak of terrifying things like self-determination and pluralistic governments."
 hee_enlightenment.3.a:0 "$MONARCH$ is a modern monarch, embracing the enlightened ideals!"
 hee_enlightenment.3.b:0 "These ideas are ridiculous, and should not be legitimised."
 hee_enlightenment.4.t:0 "Supporting the Scientific Revolution"
 hee_enlightenment.4.d:0 "In our modern day and age, the methods of the natural scientists of antiquity are coming up short. No longer is thinking and imagining the universe enough to discover the truth. Instead, self-styled \"scientists\" have begun developing strict methodologies to ensure that the theories they posit can be tested and developed. \nIt is undeniable that this has led to some incredible advances, but although they CLAIM to be thoroughly tested, the fact is that many \"scientific\" discoveries seem to go against clerical teaching."
 hee_enlightenment.4.a:0 "Knowing the truth means holding the advantage. We will support them, for $COUNTRY$!"
 hee_enlightenment.4.b:0 "The truth has already been written out for us. It's right there in the bible!"
 hee_enlightenment.5.t:0 "Discoveries of the Scientific Revolution"
 hee_enlightenment.5.d:0 "Following the development of new scientific practices, and greater emphasis on certainty even over sensibility, great new discoveries about our world seems to be made every other day. The human body, physics and even mathematics does not always work the way one would think, and our support for academic institutions and prolific scientists has helped greatly."
 hee_enlightenment.5.a:0 "It is time for the practical implementation of this knowledge."
 hee_enlightenment.5.b:0 "Continue striving for ever greater discoveries."
 hee_enlightenment.6.t:0 "$COUNTRY$ Suffers From Lack of Scientific Innovation"
 hee_enlightenment.6.d:0 "With many other countries in Europe actively supporting new developments in the eternal search for human knowledge, our insistence on adherence to the time-tested old ways means that most significant discoveries are being made elsewhere. If we do not act, $COUNTRY$ risks falling behind in crucial areas like irrigation or military ideas."
 hee_enlightenment.6.a:0 "Things will work out."
 hee_enlightenment.6.b:0 "Time to shake up our scientific establishment."
 hee_enlightenment.8.t:0 "Thinker Publishes Grand Work"
 hee_enlightenment.8.d:0 "With a long and winding title in modernized Latin, one of our foremost and brightest thinkers has, after decades of work, published their principal piece. Spanning many volumes and enough complex scientific formula or philosophical formulations to make anyone's head spin, they have illustrated an impeccable grasp of the world around us. \nEven if we cannot exactly claim to understand what it all means, it will cement $COUNTRY$'s position on the ideological world stage."
 hee_enlightenment.8.a:0 "Our magistrates should take note of this thesis on government."
 hee_enlightenment.8.b:0 "What a revolutionary view on the development of cultures."
 hee_enlightenment.8.c:0 "To even think about deploying this invention on the killing fields."
 hee_enlightenment.8.e:0 "What a marvellous new mill design."
 hee_enlightenment.8.f:0 "This new rig designs will make our ships far more durable in storms."
 hee_enlightenment.8.g:0 "A new way of mixing gunpowder that will require half the resources?!"
 hee_enlightenment.9.t:0 "Philosopher Criticizes the Church"
 hee_enlightenment.9.d:0 "One of $COUNTRY$'s most prominent Enlightenment philosophers has voiced some sharp criticism of the way the church operates in our country. \nWhile initially contained to a small circle of over-educated acquaintances, a pamphlet has now been written and is circulating with the aim of disseminating the philosopher's critique."
 hee_enlightenment.9.a:0 "We cannot pretend everything about our system is perfect."
 hee_enlightenment.9.b:0 "If we cannot prove the philosopher wrong, employ stronger measures."
 hee_enlightenment.9.c:0 "Our censorship office will ensure his ideas aren't heard."
 hee_enlightenment.10.t:0 "Philosopher Criticizes the Government"
 hee_enlightenment.10.d:0 "In a display of contempt for order, an Enlightenment philosopher has loudly voiced criticisms of our [Root.GovernmentName] in the public sphere. While it is abundantly clear to anyone that our ways of doing things are superior to anything found elsewhere on the continent or in the world, it is simply not good enough for this philosopher. \nWe could have ignored the criticism, of course, but for some reason people seem to be listening to the philospher, and agreeing with certain points."
 hee_enlightenment.10.a:0 "Let people talk, they are too far beneath us to understand the complexity of rule."
 hee_enlightenment.10.b:0 "Let us see if a few choice reforms calms the critics."
 hee_enlightenment.11.t:0 "Thinker Goes Abroad"
 hee_enlightenment.11.d:0 "In an apparent act of protest against the lack of stability and the attempt at control of public discourse in our government, one of our foremost thinkers has departed $CAPITAL$ to go abroad. While they are likely to be back - coffee just never tastes as good as the one at home, after all - their departure does not reflect well on our state."
 hee_enlightenment.11.a:0 "Cover it up as an international exchange of ideas."
 hee_enlightenment.11.b:0 "Make sure they stay where they are."
 hee_enlightenment.12.t:0 "Military Thought Suffers Under Rationalism"
 hee_enlightenment.12.d:0 "With the scientific concepts of empiricism and knowledge spreading into diverse ideologies as rationalism, thinkers are starting to consider many widely accepted military practices as downright barbaric. With public opinion turning against the less savoury aspects of war and bloodshed, military innovation develops slower than it should. Indeed, some even hold pacifist dreams of abolishing warfare althogether, replacing warriors with diplomats."
 hee_enlightenment.12.a:0 "We must build public support for a strong army."
 hee_enlightenment.12.b:0 "Ah, to dream of a world where peace is just as viable as warfare."
 hee_enlightenment.13.t:0 "Rationalism Aids Trade"
 hee_enlightenment.13.d:0 "With the development of rationalist ideas, thinkers have considered the way we have been doing trade for centuries, and found them lacking. By using samples taken from the vast number of transactions made by our merchants in markets and harbours every day, we can attempt to predict the outcome of new economic policies. Some of these ideas seem like they could be quite beneficial!"
 hee_enlightenment.13.a:0 "Ask thinkers to suggest some viable trade reforms for $COUNTRY$."
 hee_enlightenment.13.b:0 "Wait, flee flow of trade can bring in more money than mercantilism?"
 hee_enlightenment.13.c:0 "These ideas for new tolls are amazing!"
 hee_enlightenment.14.t:0 "Mercantilism Questioned"
 hee_enlightenment.14.d:0 "For centuries we have adhered to the idea that our country needs to build up treasury reserves by always exporting more value than we import. While this leads to high tariffs that can sometimes contribute to famine and goods shortages, it always ensured we had cash at hand.\nHowever, the new idea seems to be that mercantilism often worsens economic downturns, and reduces the value of our national goods in the long term. While this idea is counterintuitive and quite frankly sounds ridiculous, it has enough supporters to be worth consideration."
 hee_enlightenment.14.a:0 "Let us take steps to test out this concept of \"free trade.\""
 hee_enlightenment.14.b:0 "We need to see evidence of this before we put anything into practice."
 hee_enlightenment.14.c:0 "No, we have to make sure we have the most silver of all the countries!"
 hee_enlightenment.15.t:0 "Advances in Military Practices"
 hee_enlightenment.15.d:0 "While human universalism and occasionally even pacifism are observable among a large number of thinkers in our country, occasionally one of them will do something useful by making a realisation about military doctrine. Whether it is a technological advancement, a logistical development, or a deeper understanding of soldiers and the execution of warfare, we welcome every new idea that can help us defeat the enemies lurking at our doorstep."
 hee_enlightenment.15.a:0 "Military practice is more important to us."
 hee_enlightenment.15.b:0 "Military ideology is more important to us."
 hee_enlightenment.16.t:0 "War Criticised"
 hee_enlightenment.16.d:0 "In a recent pamphlet that has just started circulation, a prominent and - more dangerously - popular philosopher has explained in detail why the war our nation is fighting can be seen as unjust. Obviously unfamiliar with the political complexity of the situation, the philosopher could cause great harm to the war effort if public opinion was to turn."
 hee_enlightenment.16.a:0 "Let the pamphlets spread. People know better than to not support their country's wars."
 hee_enlightenment.16.b:0 "Do everything in our power to ensure that the philosopher never criticizes $COUNTRY$ again."
 hee_enlightenment.17.t:0 "Anti-government Radicalism"
 hee_enlightenment.17.d:0 "The liberal ideas fronted by so many contemporary philosophers have blossomed into an entire movement. Radicals are singing their beliefs in the streets, and state soldiers are viewed with distrust. There hasn't been an open revolt yet, but so many philosophers seem to be trying to instigate exactly that.\nTheir aim is to replace our well-functioning institutions with inefficient liberal bastardisations. It should not be this way, but the thinkers of our country seem to have declared their own ideological war against the state."
 hee_enlightenment.17.a:0 "Not all their points are useless, and an awful lot of people seem to be supporting them..."
 hee_enlightenment.17.b:0 "If they want a war, then we will show them the might of a [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 hee_enlightenment.18.t:0 "Anti-religious Work Circulates"
 hee_enlightenment.18.d:0 "In an utterly distasteful display that not too long ago would be described as heresy, a book detailing the \"wrong\" practices of the church in $COUNTRY$ has been circulating widely for some time. While it is hardly a new reformation, it does pose some challenging questions that the clergy has answered less than well."
 hee_enlightenment.18.a:0 "By the Virgin Mary, how dare they!"
 hee_enlightenment.18.b:0 "Hardly ninety-five theses. Let's just ignore it."
 hee_enlightenment.18.c:0 "God chooses for us all, and He chose for this philosopher to be an ass."
 hee_enlightenment.18.e:0 "This is an insult to a national institution."
 hee_enlightenment.18.f:0 "Not too long ago indeed. Burn the philosopher on the stake for heresy!"
 hee_enlightenment.19.t:0 "A Footnote to History"
 hee_enlightenment.19.d:0 "Ah, it seems like not so long ago we worried about criticism from a rampant philosopher. Now that we have seen the errors of our ways, those condemnations hardly seem to matter anymore."
 hee_enlightenment.19.a:0 "What were we ever concerned about."
 hee_enlightenment.20.t:0 "The Age of Enlightenment Fades"
 hee_enlightenment.20.d:0 "As with every age, one must fade to give way for a new. While we may not know what awaits our nation, the past centuries have taught us and the rest of Europe about the very nature of knowledge. Whatever the future brings, we know that we will be better prepared to face the unknown than we have ever been before."
 hee_enlightenment.20.a:0 "A new age dawns."
 hee_enlightenment.21.t:0 "The Enlightenment Ends in Revolution"
 hee_enlightenment.21.d:0 "With the dawn of the revolution, the enlightenment has come to an end. For a century and more the people of Europe have been studying the world to divine its future, and that future is eternal change. Never again will the world be shackled by the way things are and always have been, for now everyone has seen that things can be different. The world works only the way people make it. A new age has dawned, and there is fire on the horizon."
 hee_enlightenment.21.a:0 "\"We have seen the new world. To arms!\""
 hee_enlightenment.22.t:0 "A Literary Salon"
 hee_enlightenment.22.d:0 "A group of writers and thinkers have started regularly meeting for events where they exchange works, comments and advise. They seem to be helping each other develop coherent arguments and craft masterful literature, while also enjoying each others company and developing ideas.\nNow a true masterpiece has sprung forth from one of these literary salons, an absolutely stunning work possibly unparallelled in our language, at least if the literary critics are to be believed."
 hee_enlightenment.22.a:0 "Make sure the work is videly circulated."
 hee_enlightenment.22.b:0 "Present it as the finest our nation has to offer."
 hee_enlightenment.23.t:0 "Academic Society"
 hee_enlightenment.23.d:0 "At one of our country's finest academic institutions, a group of self-styled \"scientists\" in search of knowledge has grouped together to develop standardised practices for empirical experimentation. They have published their own handbook, and the early results of their work are promising. \nIt might be that the breakthrough they are looking for would come if we \"encouraged\" them in a particularly useful direction."
 hee_enlightenment.23.a:0 "Have them look into new production methods."
 hee_enlightenment.23.b:0 "We need better methods of weighing and proofing."
 hee_enlightenment.23.c:0 "If they can't invent a new cannon, we're not interested."
