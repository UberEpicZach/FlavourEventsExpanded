 fee_PAP.1.t: "Great Indulgence Salesman"
 fee_PAP.1.d: "One of our indulgence salesmen, appointed by the Pope himself after demonstrating his great skill and providing a generous donation, has turned out to be excellent at his job! Some even dare say a little too good. \nCertainly, some of the things he claims indulgences can do - such as buying a close relative out of purgatory, or make up for sins not yet committed - might not be entirely correct, but it does do the trick. Both rich and poor, bishops and farmers, nuns and harlots, are all lining up to line our coffers. We protect their eternal souls, after all."
 fee_PAP.1.a: "This man could sell indulgences to Saint Peter!"
 fee_PAP.1.b: "We should restrict some of his less pious tactics."
