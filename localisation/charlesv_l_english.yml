 charlesv_1_title:0 "The Habsburg dynasty in Castille"
 charlesv_1_desc:0 "The son of Maximillian I of Habsburg and Mary of Burgundy, Phillip I would succeed in winning the crown of Castille for the Habsburg dynasty. Already the ruler of the Austrian lowlands through his mother, in 1506 Phillip organized a coup and overthrew the acting king of Spain, Ferdinand II. Though he died mere months later, Philip's legacy would live on through his son Charles V, who would come to rule over one of the largest empires in history..."

 charlesv_2_title:0 "Charles V Ascends to the Throne"
 charlesv_2_desc:0 "With his father having died in 1506, when Charles V came of age in 1515 he aquired the title of Duke of Burgundy, which brought with it rulership over the Netherlands. A year later,the death of his grandfather Maximillian I made him ruler of all the Habsburg posessions in Germany, including the Archduchy of Austria.That same year, the death of Ferdinand II left the crowns of Aragon, Castille, and Leon to his mother Joanna. With Joanna being unsound of mind, Charles was declared co-ruler of each kingdom, and assumed de facto rulership over his mother's posessions. Finally, Charles was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1530. Taken altogether, Charles V's dominion encompassed most of Iberia, large portions of Western and Central Europe, as well as the Spanish colonies in Asia and the Americas. This arrangement, however, did not sit well with France, who felt cornered by their Habsburg enemies and were eager to reverse their fortunes. Nor did it please the other nations of Europe, who did not take kindly to Charles's dream of a universal Christian empire..."

 charlesv_3_title:0 "Charles V Grows Weary"
 charlesv_3_desc:0 "The life of a King has not been easy on Chalres V. His dream of a united Christian Empire had been thwarted by the English and the French, with the rise of Protestantism dealing the final blow. As his ambitions failed, so too did his health, as he suffered terribly from gout as he entered middle age. By 1554, it had all become too much to bear. That year he handed the title of Holy Roman Empire to his brother Ferdinand, and abdicated the titles of Spain and the Netherlands to his son, Phillip. Longing for peace, he spent the rest of his days in a monestary, where he would die in 1558. Though he wished his Empire would live on without him, disputes between Ferdinand and Phillip would see his lands divided between Spain and Austria."

 charlesv_10_title:0 "The Death of Charles V"
 charlesv_10_desc:0 "With Charles V dead, the future of his empire has been the subject of great contention, both at home and abroad. While nearly everyone agrees that his son Phillip II should inherit the thrones of Castille, Aragon, and the Lowlands, there is disagreement regarding his claim to the crown of Austria, and his father’s other titles in Germany. There, it is said, the local nobles are more inclined to view Charles’s brother Ferdinand von Habsburg as their rightful ruler, a notion which Ferdinand seems in no hurry to correct. Whatever the legality of this claim, the court in Spain seems apprehensive towards a conflict with the German wing of the family, and Phillip’s closest advisors have even suggested that a conflict with Austria could do more harm than good…"
 charlesv.10.a:0 "His Empire shall be divided between [Root.GetName] and Austria"
 charlesv.10.a.tt:0 "In the division of the Habsburg lands, it has been decided that due to the origin of Charles V and his cadet house of Von Habsburg in Spain's ancestry in the Burgundian lands, that in return for the surrender of the Personal Union's gained from Austria, back to Austria, The Austrian Netherlands and France Compte shall be transfered to Spainish domain, although any other Holy Roman Terrority held by the Spainish were to be transfered back to Austria. \nWith this Iberia would leave the Holy Roman Empire for good."
