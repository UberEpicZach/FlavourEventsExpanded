 fee_BUR.2.d: "The great wealth of the Burgundians had become legendary in Western Europe by the mid-15th century. So great was it, some said, that an average Burgundian knight was wealthier that the King of France! One of the expressions of this wealth were the enormous and extravagant feasts hosted by the Dukes. Rich wines, exotic meats, spectacular troubadour and jongleur performances, fancy desserts, and beautiful wares all enchanted guests from all over Christendom, and this in turn made Burgundian luxury items in more demand. Burgundian styles became the most prominent in Europe in the 15th century, even surpassing the dazzling Venetians. With enough saint feast days to cover all the year round, shall we host another feast to remind our friends and enemies alike of our greatness?"
