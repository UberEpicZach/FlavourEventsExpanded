 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.1.T: "The Jews of Sicily"
 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.1.D: "The presence of Jews in Sicily is attested by archaeological finds starting from the third century BC. Rabbi Akiva visited the city of Syracuse during one of his trips abroad. In the first centuries after Christ: at the end of the sixth century this presence was confirmed by some letters from Pope Gregory the Great. But in 1310 the King of Sicily Frederick III adopted a restrictive policy towards the Jews, who were forced to mark their clothes and their shops with the "red wheel". He also forbade them any relationship with Christians."

 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.2.T: "Sinagoga of Savoca"
 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.2.D: "In 1470 there is news of a restrictive measure against the Jews residing in Savoca, concerning the synagogue of that city. Since said building of worship was located in a neighborhood inhabited by Christians, moreover close to churches (Church of San Michele) and to the "Palazzo della Curia" within which the city administration and magistrates were located, in August 1470, it was confiscated by order of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The viceroy himself ordered that the synagogue be built in another place. The reason for this provision is to be found in the fact that the Savocese Jews, in officiating their rites, sang hymns in such a loud voice as to disturb the civil, judicial and liturgical activities of the Christians that took place a few steps from there. The confiscated synagogue was sold to a local Christian citizen, a certain Fulippu Sturiali who had to pay his fellow Jews a sum equal to ¼ of the value of the property and "deliver or sell" a land or a building on which said Jews could have built or transfer their synagogue. Having done this, the new buyer transformed the church building into a residential home."

 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.3.D: "Each Jewish community in Sicily was called aliama or judaica (Judaica) or giudecca. These communities, in the late Middle Ages, enjoyed their own political, administrative, judicial and patrimonial autonomy; they provided for the imposition and collection of taxes, and performed basic services (such as school, notary, hospital, cemetery, slaughterhouse and assistance to the most needy). Each Jewish woman had a deliberative body represented by the regional council, which in turn elected the proti (which formed the executive body) and the tax committee (which divided the burden of donations to be paid to the treasury among the families). Other roles were exercised by the shochet (slaughterhouse attendant), the mohel (the one who performed the circumcision) and the shammashim (who took care of the synagogue)."

 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.6.T: "Jewish community of Naples"
 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.6.D: "The first sure traces of Jewish presence in Naples and its surroundings date back to the first century AD: a Jewish presence is documented by graffiti and wall inscriptions in Pompeii, a city of some importance for its port. \n\nBenjamin of Tudela, on a visit to the city in 1159, reported the presence of about 500 families of the Jewish faith residents: it was therefore a considerable community, lower only to that of Salerno, which, with its 600 families, was probably the largest in mainland Italy. The presence of this large community suggests a continuity of settlement maintained from Antiquity through the centuries of the High Middle Ages. This appears confirmed by the news that begin to appear towards the end of the interlude of the High Middle Ages: in the 10th century we know of their location in a vicus judaeorum, while in 1097 the presence of a synagogue hebraeorum is attested. Very important, to testify the good living conditions of the Neapolitan community, is then a news of 1153 about the conclusion, by a Jew, of the exchange of a land with two rooms adjacent to the synagogue, with the possibility of using one of them as a school or a second synagogue: it is proved not only the prerogative of real estate possession, often denied elsewhere, but also the possibility to dispose of this property with considerable freedom, so as to be able to change the use of their property to transform them into places of worship. \nIn 1165 is then attested a schola hebraeorum, whose institution is probably to be linked to the faculty of destination granted with the act of exchange previously mentioned. \n\nIn 1231, Federico II of Svevia, collected in the Liber Augustalis (Constitutions melfitane) a series of dispositions, normanne and swabian, that indicated the Hebrews like servi nostrae camerae, subtracting them to the pressures of the local lords and the clergy and extending an attitude filosemita to all the Reign of Sicily: Jews placed under the direct protection of the sovereign and were equalized with Gentiles with regard to the right of defense and the possibility of proceeding to trial; the practice of money lending is regulated, placing an interest rate not exceeding 10%. This last norm, in particular, especially in the following age of the Angevin domination, opened the way to the penetration in Naples of bankers and businessmen coming from Pisa and Provence, and favored the economic activity of the Jews of Trani and Oria. \n\nDeclined the era of Frederick II and his epigones, the climate began to change. From 1288, and above all from 1290 to 1294, a real "storm" fell on the Jews, the result of the skilful anti-Jewish preaching of the Dominican preachers who had already been practicing their arguments for a quarter of a century, and which had risen even higher with the succession of Charles the lame to Charles of Anjou. \nIn 1288 the kingdom of Naples decreed expulsion for Jews, and in 1293 Jews were incentivized to convert in exchange for ad vitam exemption from paying taxes."
