 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.1.T: "The Jews of Sicily"
 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.1.D: "The presence of Jews in Sicily is attested by archaeological finds starting from the third century BC. Rabbi Akiva visited the city of Syracuse during one of his trips abroad. In the first centuries after Christ: at the end of the sixth century this presence was confirmed by some letters from Pope Gregory the Great. But in 1310 the King of Sicily Frederick III adopted a restrictive policy towards the Jews, who were forced to mark their clothes and their shops with the "red wheel". He also forbade them any relationship with Christians."

 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.2.T: "Sinagoga of Savoca"
 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.2.D: "In 1470 there is news of a restrictive measure against the Jews residing in Savoca, concerning the synagogue of that city. Since said building of worship was located in a neighborhood inhabited by Christians, moreover close to churches (Church of San Michele) and to the "Palazzo della Curia" within which the city administration and magistrates were located, in August 1470, it was confiscated by order of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The viceroy himself ordered that the synagogue be built in another place. The reason for this provision is to be found in the fact that the Savocese Jews, in officiating their rites, sang hymns in such a loud voice as to disturb the civil, judicial and liturgical activities of the Christians that took place a few steps from there. The confiscated synagogue was sold to a local Christian citizen, a certain Fulippu Sturiali who had to pay his fellow Jews a sum equal to ¼ of the value of the property and "deliver or sell" a land or a building on which said Jews could have built or transfer their synagogue. Having done this, the new buyer transformed the church building into a residential home."

 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.3.D: "Each Jewish community in Sicily was called aliama or judaica (Judaica) or giudecca. These communities, in the late Middle Ages, enjoyed their own political, administrative, judicial and patrimonial autonomy; they provided for the imposition and collection of taxes, and performed basic services (such as school, notary, hospital, cemetery, slaughterhouse and assistance to the most needy). Each Jewish woman had a deliberative body represented by the regional council, which in turn elected the proti (which formed the executive body) and the tax committee (which divided the burden of donations to be paid to the treasury among the families). Other roles were exercised by the shochet (slaughterhouse attendant), the mohel (the one who performed the circumcision) and the shammashim (who took care of the synagogue)."

 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.6.T: "Jewish community of Naples"
 FEE_Jews_Italy_Events.6.D: "In the annals of Naples and its environs, the earliest certain signs of Jewish habitation harken back to the first age of our era. In Pompeii, a metropolis of no small renown for its harbor, scrawlings and engravings upon walls do attest to the existence of a Jewish community.\n\nIn the year 1159 Benjamin of Tudela, a renowned traveler, visited the great city and reported the presence of a thriving community of the Jewish faith. Five hundred families called it home, a number surpassed only by the grand community of Salerno, which boasted six hundred families. This community's longevity was a testament to their steadfastness and resilience, for they had maintained their settlement from Antiquity through the centuries of the High Middle Ages.\n\nIn the ancient tomes of lore, evidence of their presence within the great city could be discovered. In the tenth age, they dwelt within a vicus judaeorum, and by the year of our Lord 1097, a grand synagogue hebraeorum had been erected. But it was a most propitious moment in the year 1153 that truly spoke to the prosperity of the Neapolitan community. In the year of grace twelve hundred and thirty-one, the great king Federico of the Swabian folk gathered in the Book of Augustus (the Melfitan Laws) many decrees of old, from the Normans and his own kin, that named the Jews as thralls of his treasury, and freed them from the thraldom of the local lords and the clergy, and showed a friendly mind to all the Jews in his realm of Sicily: for he took them under his kingly shield and gave them equal rights with the Gentiles in matters of justice and strife; and he ordered the craft of money-lending, setting a limit of interest that should not pass ten in the hundred.\n\nBut when the days of Federico the Second and his heirs waned, the mood of the world changed. From the year twelve hundred and eighty-eight, and most of all from twelve hundred and ninety to twelve hundred and ninety-four, a great “storm” broke upon the Jews, wrought by the cunning words of the Black Friars who had honed their speech against them for many years, and which grew yet fiercer with the coming of Charles the Lame after Charles of Anjou."
