 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.1.T: "Intervention Requested by Bibi Raji"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.1.D: "Turmoil erupted within the borders of the Delhi Sultanate as the Sayyid rulers were forced into exile following the rebellion of the Governor of Sirhind, Bahlol Lodi. Our Sultan’s favourite wife, Bibi Raji, the sister of the deposed Alam Shah has requested us to intervene in this conflict and put an end to the tyranny perpetrated by the Lodi savages. While this may be a prime opportunity to capture the city of Delhi and reverse our previous humiliation, our populace has grown immensely tired by the state of constant war. Even though we outnumber them on the battlefield, we must be wary of Bahlol’s strategic brilliance, for if we lose this gambit, our hegemony over Hindustan may be forever lost."
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.1.OPT1: "Rally the Faujdaars! We ride to war!"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.1.OPT2: "Only a minor hurdle for our Sultan"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.1.OPT3: "A fruitless endeavour"

 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.2.T: "The Rebellion of the Ujjainiya Rajputs"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.2.D: "While our realm stretches across wide swathes of land, many of these territories are ruled by local chiefs on our behalf. Most of these chiefs have continued to prove their loyalty to the Sharqi Sultans, yet there have been certain…unruly ones. The most rowdy of these chiefs have been the Ujjainiya Rajputs, inhabiting the rich region of Bhojpur. Rumour has it that hostilities erupted between our forces after Malik Sarwar’s army disturbed the local Brahmin priests during the campaign of Chausa. Since then, these hooligans have waged a long guerilla war against our state, disrupting our supply lines and harassing our caravans. After years of dormancy however, they have returned with a greater force under the command of a capable commander, Sangram Deo. Let us crush their vile mutiny and restore order and stability to Bhojpur once and for all."
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.2.OPT1: "Send in the soldiers… again"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.2.OPT2: "The Sultan can sort the matter out himself"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.2.OPT3: "I want their corpses hung from a Banyan Tree!"

 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.3.T: "Sufi Premakhyan"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.3.D: "Under the patronage of the Sharqi Sultans, Jaunpur developed as a centre of creativity and spirituality. The thousands of Sufi saints who called Jaunpur home expressed their devotion to the Supreme Maker by writing Premakhyans (“love-lores”). These poems, in order to reach a wider audience were usually composed in dialects local to their place of origin, such as Awadhi,  instead of the court language - Persian. Many Premakhyans possessed similar themes and writing styles, such as the awakening of love between the hero and heroine after a vision, prophecy or divine intervention and a tragic ending, the untimely death of lovers who were never meant to be together. One of the most prominent love-lores during the rule of the Sharqis was the Mrigavati, written by the Sufi saint Shaikh Qutban Suhrawadi, the story of a Rajkumar whose desire for a princess, disguised as a seven-coloured doe led him into various near-death experiences. The poet used vivid geographic imagery to describe the internal struggles of the prince and his yearning for knowledge which leads him down the road to becoming a yogi. These prose left a deep impact on the populace, since the trend of composing Premakhyan continued well after the collapse of the Jaunpur Sultanate, with recitals such as “Padmaavat” being completed during the Mughal Era."
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.3.OPT1: "Fascinating!"

 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.4.T: "Proliferation of the Shahnai and Jaunpuri Music"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.4.D: "Music played an immensely important role in the Jaunpuri court. Music of the Provincial Sultanate was an intricate fusion of classical Hindustani and Persian, and often sung praises of the Sharqi Sultans. The rulers were also great patrons of music, with Sultan Hussain Shah being widely credited for the creation of the “Jaunpuri” Raga, which gained immense fame across India due to its melodious swaras (notes). Further, an instrument similar to the “pungee” called the Shahnai (The King’s Reed) was developed in Jaunpur. While its initial use was limited to the city itself, it later spread to other parts of India following the Mughal invasions, finding widespread use in auspicious occasions like marriages and religious ceremonies among both Hindus and Muslims."
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.4.OPT1: "Interesting."

 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.5.T: "Raiding the Garjati Forests"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.5.D: "Elephants form a core part of our nation’s army. They are used for various purposes, such as transporting heavy siege equipment, for traversing terrain unsuitable for horses or purely for the psychological damage their roars invoke on the enemy army. However, due to constant poaching for their precious tusks, the population of Elephants in the Gangetic Plains has reduced to abysmal levels. Following our recent victory against the Garjati Lords and the acquisition of several cities deep within the jungles of Central India, we have discovered a large, mostly undisturbed population of these majestic beasts. Perhaps we should take the advantage of this surplus of Elephants and refill our depleted cavalry regiments with these beasts."
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.5.OPT1: "Better take these Elephants home!"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.5.OPT2: "Let’s use them for their conventional roles instead"
 FEE_Jaunpur_Events.5.OPT3: "The armies of our foe shall tremble!"
