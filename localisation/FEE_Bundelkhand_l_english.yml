 events_bnd.1.tt: "The Establishment of Orchha" 
 events_bnd.1.dd: "The Bundela Rajputs of Bundelkhand, which the region was named after, had previously had a capital at Garh Kundar. However, in 1531, Raja Rudra Pratap Singh sought to change this. He established a new city named 'Orchha' along the banks of the Betwa River and died the year after.  The capital itself was defended by a fort, and this ushered in a new age of the nation. After Rudra Pratap Singh's death, his son, Bharatichand, took the reins as the second king of the Bundela state—now renamed to Orchha—and it would remain as Orchha for over four centuries."
