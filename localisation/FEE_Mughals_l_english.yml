His situation was so dire that wandering through the mountains he and his followers only had 1 tent which was used by his mother.

 FEE_Mughals_Events.5.D: "As Babur, the rightful heir to the legacies of Timur and Genghis Khan, you have risen from the harsh and unforgiving lands of Afghanistan to amass a formidable force. With several failures to recapture Samarkand, It is time to try your luck and extend your reach beyond the rugged mountains of Kabul. The fertile and prosperous lands of Punjab now lie open before you, a gateway to the riches of India. This is your destiny-to step into India and begin your conquest, carving out an empire that will stand the test of time. The world will soon witness the rise of a new power."
 FEE_Mughals_Events.5.OPT1: "Punjab is my ancestral claim"

 FEE_Mughals_Events.6.T: "The Struggle for Punjab"
 FEE_Mughals_Events.6.D: "The time has come to assert your claim over this vital region. While war is always an option, a diplomatic approach may yield quicker results. Send envoys to Delhi, demanding the cession of Punjab under the shadow of your growing might.

Though his current realm may not be vast, the blood of Timur and Genghis Khan flows through his veins, and his growing power cannot be dismissed lightly. The question now looms over our court: should we contest Babur's claim to Punjab, risking a confrontation with a potential conqueror? Or should we concede the territory, avoiding a conflict that could threaten the stability of our Sultanate? The fate of Punjab-and perhaps Delhi itself-hangs in the balance."

 FEE_Mughals_Events.8.T: "Delhi Refuses Demands"
 FEE_Mughals_Events.8.D: "The Sultan of Delhi has dared to deny your rightful claim to Punjab, ignoring the bloodline that traces back to the great Timur and Genghis Khan. Such an insult cannot stand. It is time to rally your forces and march to war. With your newly strengthened army, you will teach the Sultan the price of defiance. The battlefield awaits, and your destiny as a conqueror will be forged in the fires of war. Victory will be yours, and the path to domination in North-Western India will be clear."

 FEE_Mughals_Events.9.D: "The audacity of Babur knows no bounds. How could this upstart from Kabul dare to challenge the might of the Delhi Sultanate? We have ruled over nearly all of India, and our legacy is not one to be trifled with by a brash, untested ruler. His bloodline may boast of grand ancestors, but we are the enduring power of the subcontinent. The time has come to remind him that the Sultanate of Delhi will not be cowed by a child still basking in the glory of his forefathers. War will be his lesson, and defeat his fate."

 FEE_Mughals_Events.10.D: "The unthinkable has happened. The siege is lost, and with it, our hopes and dreams. The Afghan Eagle, once soaring high with ambition, has plummeted to the earth, shattered by the might of Delhi. The enemy is within our gates, and all that remains is ruin. The dream of conquering Punjab has crumbled into dust. Now, all that is left is to flee, to hide in the shadows while there is still time. The dream is lost - perhaps forever."
 FEE_Mughals_Events.10.OPT1: "I have no choice but to give up on Punjab."

With this decisive triumph, we have carved our legacy into the annals of history, echoing the wrath of Timur.
