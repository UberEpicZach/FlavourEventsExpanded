Embrace expansionist ambitions, reclaiming the territories that once showcased Andhra as a military powerhouse. Restoring our historical prominence on the subcontinent could mark a new chapter in the saga of Andhra."

The time has come to make a pivotal decision that will shape the destiny of our kingdom. \nFueled by a desire to resurrect the grandeur of the Satavahana dynasty, we opt to embark on a journey to reclaim the ancient legacy. This path involves reconquering lost lands in both the west and south, striving to recreate the once-mighty Satavahana empire.

The Telugu spirit shall be reborn, and the lost glory reforged. \nAlternatively, recognizing the challenges and risks associated with such a bold endeavour, we may choose to preserve the current legacy. This path entails maintaining the existing state of affairs, refraining from ambitious reconquests, and focusing on the stability and prosperity of the present kingdom.
