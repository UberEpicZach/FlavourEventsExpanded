He has travelled throughout the country, performing pious deeds such as asceticism, donations to Jewish organisations in our lands, speaking of his visions of his God. While in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] our Grand Vizier decided to put a stop to this Heathenry, imprisoning him. However Zevi requests an audience with the Sultan himself!
