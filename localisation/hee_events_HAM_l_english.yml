 hee_HAM.1.t:0 "Langer Rezeß"
 hee_HAM.1.d:0 "In 1529, the senate of Hamburg asked Johannes Bugenhagen to institute a protestant church in the city, and thereby officially converted to Lutheranism. This went down far more calmly in Hamburg than most other places, largely due to the political reforms of \"the long compromise\" which had made it so that no law could be passed without the approval of the council of citizens. \nWhile Catholics lost their citizenships and many moved, the remaining ones were not pursued further, and were even allowed to worship in their own small chapels."
 hee_HAM.1.a:0 "Hamburg is a city not for emperors or gods, but for its citizens."
 hee_HAM.2.t:0 "The Hamburg Stock Exchange"
 hee_HAM.2.d:0 "Established in 1558, the Hamburg Stock Exchange was one of the first stock exchanges in Germany, allowing traders to invest in merchant routes across the Baltic and the North Sea.\n\nWhile it began as quite a basic marketplace for money, hardly recognisable today as a \"stock market,\" the Hamburg Stock Exchange would develop along with advances in finance and financing into a modern economic institution. Today it is the oldest stock exchange still in operation in Germany."
 hee_HAM.2.a:0 "This will allow our state greater access to private funds."
 hee_HAM.2.b:0 "If the state invests significantly we will have more control over national finances."
