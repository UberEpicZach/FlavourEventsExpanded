 FEE_Marathas_Events.1.T: "Uprising of the Marathas!"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.1.D: "For centuries, the Marathi people have been ruled by outsiders granting them their superior laws and customs. Despite our best efforts to make them understand how beneficial our rule has been for them, the dream of an independent Marathi kingdom is stronger than ever before. \n\nThis desire has allowed a Marathi warrior by the name of Shivaji to raise a small army. Some of our unprepared forts were quickly overrun, and he already dares claim the title of \"Raj\". \n\nWe must show this Marathi \"kingdom\" the price of disloyalty."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.1.OPT1: "For all the lands of $COUNTRY$!"

 FEE_Marathas_Events.2.T: "Fort Commanders Betray Us"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.2.D: "Shivaji's campaign for Marathi independence and Hindu self-rule is extending across all our Marathi lands. Now, through bribery, negotiations, or false promises of a better kind of freedom he is attracting new loyalties. Several of our forts in $PROVINCE$ have sworn allegiance to him, letting the false raj extend his power there!"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.2.OPT1: "It is time we put an end to this."

 FEE_Marathas_Events.3.T: "Fort Defects to $MONARCH$"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.3.D: "Following success after success in the lands of the Marathas, the dream of an independent kingdom is getting stronger. \nNow, thanks to the indomitable leadership displayed by [Root.Monarch.GetName], several forts have defected to us. With their garrisons by our side, we have seized the land surrounding them."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.3.OPT1: "The strength of the Marathas is ever growing."

 FEE_Marathas_Events.4.T: "Doing What Needs to be Done"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.4.D: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] was called to negotiations by the enemy general. They would both appear with only one bodyguard, and no other weapons but a sword each. \nOf course, it is clear the general was not really looking for a peaceful solution, or he would not have set such an obvious trap. \n\nWith metal tiger claws hidden underneath his armour, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was ready when the general moved to strike. It is said that with blood pouring from his mouth, the general cursed the name of \"[Root.Monarch.GetName]\". To the Marathas storming over the hill to ambush the general's troops, it was a battlecry. \n\nThe enemy army shattered in moments."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.4.OPT1: "[Root.Monarch.GetName], the warrior, the general, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"

 FEE_Marathas_Events.5.T: "Negotiations and Betrayal!"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.5.D: "In an attempt at reconciliation with the upstart Marathi kingdom, one of our greatest generals called for negotiations with \"[From.Monarch.GetTitle]\" [From.Monarch.GetName]. They were to meet with only one bodyguard, and no other weapons but a sword each. Thus they would find a solution to the war and stop the bloodshed. \n\nA peaceful solution appears not to interest our enemy, however. With metal tiger claws hidden underneath his armour, [From.Monarch.GetName] struck at our loyal general, murdering him in a holy place. \nTo make matters worse, an army of Marathas poured forth from hiding, slaying those of our soldiers who hoped for the war to end that day. \n\nSuch a betrayal must never be allowed to happen again."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.5.OPT1: "The time for negotiation is over. This ends in blood."

 FEE_Marathas_Events.6.T: "Western Aid"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.6.D: "With the Marathas still resilient to our overwhelming force, severe action is required. With western countries establishing themselves in India, the opportunity to use their military expertise should not go unfeeded. \n\nAs they worry about stability and trade among the Indian states, we have been offered the use of their artillery to help siege the rebellious forts and cities."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.6.OPT1: "With these weapons we'll bring the Marathas to feel."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.6.OPT2: "[Root.GetAdjective] discipline will be enough."

 FEE_Marathas_Events.7.T: "$FROM$ Relies on Foreign Weaponry"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.7.D: "We have time and time again been denied trade with the westerners in India, and now the reason is clear. $FROM$ is attempting to monopolise European weaponry, and the Europeans are playing along. Not only has $FROM$ acquired new, trained artillery, they have also employed western soldiers still fighting under the banner of their home country! \n\nWith a raid on a European factory or trade store, we too could secure these tools of war."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.7.OPT1: "Those who support $FROM$ deserve nothing less!"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.7.OPT2: "We must focus on the real enemy."

 FEE_Marathas_Events.8.T: "Birth of Nagpur"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.8.D: "In their grand mission to unite the Vedic peoples under one Hindu state, the Marathas faced the inevitable challenges that accompany the expansion of any vast empire. India, with its immense diversity, presented a unique set of obstacles. The Marathas, despite their strength and determination, found that controlling such a multifaceted land was a daunting task. The multitude of interpretations of the same faith, combined with significant cultural blocks each vying for dominance, added to the complexity of governance. One of the most formidable challenges arose as the Marathas ventured into the Bengal delta and the lower Ganges valley. This region, traditionally influenced by the Bengal Sultanate, had a substantial Muslim population, the largest concentration of Muslims the Marathas had encountered thus far. The intricacies of managing a diverse population with different religious and cultural backgrounds made the task of control even more difficult. To address these challenges, the Marathas established a military government in the form of a kingdom specifically designed to govern this region. They entrusted the leadership of this new kingdom to a minor branch of the Bhonsale dynasty. This branch of the family would play a crucial role in integrating the region into the Maratha Empire and later serve as a buffer state against the encroaching British forces. To ensure loyalty and effective administration, the entire Bhonsale clan relocated to this region. They established a dynastic administration, with the head of the clan also serving as the military leader. This structure was intended to maintain a strong connection to the greater Maratha Empire and ensure that the region remained under firm control. The Bhonsale dynasty, through their governance and military oversight, worked tirelessly to integrate the diverse populace and maintain stability. Their presence and leadership became the cornerstone of the Maratha strategy to hold onto this critical part of their empire. This arrangement was designed to last as long as the empire needed it to, providing a resilient framework for managing the region's complexities. In this way, the Marathas endeavoured to overcome the formidable challenges of empire-building in a land as diverse as India, using the Bhonsale dynasty's leadership and military prowess to solidify their control over the Bengal delta and the lower Ganges valley."

 FEE_Marathas_Events.8.OPT2: "No need."

 FEE_Marathas_Events.9.T: "Birth of Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.9.D: "The birth of a new scion of a noble house is always an event worth visiting, with celebrations often ongoing for days on end. [Root.Monarch.GetName], as honoured guest, certainly enjoyed the festivities as much as anyone else. And yet, there was something different about this birth. Already, the midwife who helped his passage into the land of men had prophesied that he was destined for great things... Now, to be sure, how often did that come true? But even now, looking from across the room at the newborn, there was indeed something different here. Although only days old, the infant’s eyes were already sharp and alert, darting around the room here and there, taking in what was happening. Surely he didn’t already understand the adult conversations around him... did he? With an ever-so-slight shudder, [Root.Monarch.GetName] waved off the strange feeling, but made a mental note. Perhaps this newborn was worth keeping as close as possible..."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.9.OPT1: "Adopt him as my own."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.9.OPT2: "We will watch your career with great interest"

 FEE_Marathas_Events.10.T: "Coming of Age"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.10.D: "The young man lovingly referred to as Shivaji had impressed all who he met since he was a baby. With age, it only became clearer how intelligent and capable this man would become. From the age of 12 he would put our master tacticians to shame and out-duel most of our professional soldiers. Starting at age 13, he would gain his first military command, although locally as a guard captain. He's become more of a tactician and military man at 15 then most of our old scruffy generals ever were. He as of late during his 15th birthday has shown greater interest in the court and the state. While his military intellect would be slightly wasted at court his capabilities could prove vital for the future of our state. What to do, what to do..."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.10.OPT1: "He should lead our armies!"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.10.OPT2: "I proclaim him our new heir!"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.10.OPT3: "We have no need of this boy"

 FEE_Marathas_Events.11.T: "A Change of Course?"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.11.D: "The enthronement of Shivaji upon the throne of our great [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] has proven to enact the winds of change. The incompetence of both the Muslim Sultanates, the Christian European and even the ever divided Hindus became clear to Shivaji. Upon his ascension to the throne he declared this age of division and incompetence would come to an end for the subcontinent and its people. “We have suffered long enough” he decreed. Thus he swore to bring about the birth not of not only a new realm, one that stood above religious drabble and infighting that had divided us for so long. This could go either of two ways. All depending on the lower nobility Shivaji needed the support of. They would either cheer on in great support and swear fealty to this new realm abandoning the ideals of [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName]. Or they would stick to their old ways and seize power for themselves, only time will tell."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.11.OPT1: "We will reorganise into the First Maratha Empire!"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.11.OPT2: "Out with the new in with the old!"

 FEE_Marathas_Events.12.T: "Shivaji’s Loyalty Questioned"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.12.D: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] invited his war ministry and his independent generals to court. This included Shivaji who would be placed among the generals and military leaders of the war ministry. After a while it became clear he was not only uncomfortable, but seemed rather furious. When asked by [Root.Monarch.GetName] if he was dissatisfied with what was being discussed, Shivaji exclaimed that this was an insult to his capabilities. The question then soon came as to what he meant by this. Shivaji exclaimed once more: you have me posted up here by lesser men I have already defeated in open or personal combat. Per military tradition this is a disservice to my rank as supreme victor in the court and your military ministry. Shivaji would then storm out with a few supporters. With [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his court baffled, the hindu priest did come to Shivaji's defence that it is indeed tradition that a man shall not share a table with those whom he has defeated in combat. Upon this revelation the ministry looked at [Root.Monarch.GetName] to see his response to the act of disrespect on Shivaji's side. One does not leave court without being dismissed. How shall you rule on this my liege?"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.12.OPT1: "He makes a good point however."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.12.OPT2: "So treason it is!"

 FEE_Marathas_Events.13.T: "Rogue General Loots the Countryside"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.13.D: "It's been months since one of the greatest generals in Deccani history was declared a traitor for standing up for his rights. We have been plagued with a rogue army pillaging and destroying vital military infrastructure ever since. After months of chasing ghosts, we have finally identified this army as the disgraced band of soldiers led by Shivaji in revenge against [Root.Monarch.GetName]. His army is made up from his former veterans and minor nobility that stood by his side when he was declared a traitor and want justice for their great leader. A message got back to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that Shivaji would continue to seek support and create havoc in [Root.GetName] until he would have [Root.Monarch.GetName] head on a pike, his name cleared and all forms of injustices be undone."
 FEE_Marathas_Events.13.OPT1: "Curses!"

 FEE_Marathas_Events.14.T: "Rise of Shivaji"
 FEE_Marathas_Events.14.D: "Dissatisfied with the dealing and rule of the muslims and the Hindus alike in the Deccan, Shivaji vowed to end this incompetence. Assembling by his side a small number of Noble clans, priests and high ranking ministers, Shivaji would declare a  new state. This state also had the backing from the existing bureaucracy; crucially, this also included many from the royal accounts and treasury, who spent months secretly funnelling the state revenues to him. would be structured based on the clan system of the Marathas Shivaji himself hailed from. The state also had the Carving out his own realm on the backs of not only his military and diplomatic expertise, but the military expertise of all the Maratha clans. They would erect a state meant to maintain Hindu traditions and religion that were banned by some Muslim rulers, while adhering to virtues of tolerance and meritocracy. Thus was born the Maratha movement that would historically lead to the great revolt not 3 months later."
