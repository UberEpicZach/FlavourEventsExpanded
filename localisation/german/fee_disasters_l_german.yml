  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.1.T: "Portuguese Succession Crisis"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.1.D: "As a result of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] shaky claim to the [Root.GetAdjective] throne, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ascension to the [Root.GetAdjective] throne prompted a dynastic crisis. Several claimants have gathered supporters and declared themselves the rightful kings of [Root.GetName]. The confusion has led to a breakdown of law and order within the Kingdom as various pretenders fight each other as well as the central government in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.1.OPT1: "Support the Monarch!"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.1.OPT2: "Support a New King!"

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.2.T: "The Succession is Secure"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.2.D: "After a long and bitter struggle, the last rebelling army has laid down their arms. Regardless of whether the new king is lawful or even legitimate, the fact is that he has enforced his rule and none are left who can now challenge him. In any case, few would wish to return to the chaos and anarchy of the previous years. As the crown manages to regain control over the kingdom, the [Root.GetAdjective] people breathe a sigh of relief as they look for recovery of prosperity in the future."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.2.OPT1: "At least the fighting is over..."

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.3.T: "Spread of Civil War"

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.3.OPT1: "No Loyalty..."

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.4.T: "Chaos Engulfs the Provinces"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.4.D: "Protesting their new king, widely seen as illegitimate, as well as the breakdown of central control and the rule of law, peasants and burghers alike have taken up arms themselves. Seeking to overthrow the nobility, they ironically rebel to demand a return to order."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.4.OPT1: "How strange..."

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.5.T: "The Cardinal who would be King"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.5.D: "In addition to the royal and noble claimants to the throne, the uncle of the late king, a Cardinal, has also sought to become ruler, and rather successfully. In seeking to revive the fortunes of the Avis dynasty, he also plans to petition the Pope to revoke his clerical position and take a royal bride."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.5.OPT1: "Support him as the true King."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.5.OPT2: "We don't need him."

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.6.T: "A Special Request"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.6.D: "To curtail the unrest in [From.GetName], a Cardinal has used his position as the uncle of the late king to seize the throne. To secure his family line, he asks us to release him from his clerical vow of celibacy."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.6.OPT1: "Accept his request."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.6.OPT2: "It is against the Church!"

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.7.T: "Holy Father Accepts"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.7.D: "With a heart full of love for his flock in [Root.GetName], the Holy Father has granted our request to put aside [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s vows for the good of the country."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.7.OPT1: "The throne grows more secure!"

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.8.T: "Holy Father Refuses"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.8.D: "Undoubtedly influenced by those who wish us harm, the Pope has refused our reasonable request."

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.9.T: "Nobility Worried"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.9.D: "Concerned that the ongoing succession crisis threatens to undermine their independence, the [Root.GetAdjective] nobility have sought to get rid of pretenders... themselves."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.9.OPT1: "This is fine..."

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.10.T: "Spanish Intervention"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.10.D: "You shouldn't be able to see this hidden event."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.10.OPT1: "Please report it to the team if you see it."

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.11.T: "Portuguese Succession Crisis"
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.11.D: "While for centuries being the most stable of the Iberian crowns, recent years have seen [From.GetName] fall into disarray due to the succession crisis. This would be a perfect opportunity for us, as the rightful rulers of all of Hispania, should we choose to risk involvement."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.11.OPT1: "Interfere in [From.GetName]."
  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.11.OPT2: "[From.GetName] is our friend and ally!"

  disaster_fee_portuguese_succession_crisis.12.OPT1: "We must prepare for invasion!"

 # Ottomans
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.1.T: "The Decline of the Ottomans"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.1.D: "While the rest of the world changed and entered modernity, the Ottoman Empire did not. Their strength in earlier ages left them complacent and strongly opposed to change. The Sultans themselves largely withdrew from governance and enjoyed their harems while corrupt nobles, radical clergymen, the decadent, outmoded officer corps, and others vied for true control over the empire. In addition, control by the central government, known as the Sublime Porte, is rapidly waning in the face of this decadence, as provincial governors often function more and more independently. The Ottomans were still feared throughout Europe for their mighty armies, but if the system is not reformed quickly, the Turkish weakness will not long continue to go unnoticed..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.1.OPT1: "The Empire must endure!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.2.T: "Tanzimat"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.2.D: "After the long years of decay, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has finally managed to right the ship of state and begin the long period of recovery. His vision, known as Tanzimat (Reform), intends to reshape the Ottoman state into a functioning modern society. By curtailing the ruling classes, ensuring equal protection of the laws for all, and reforming institutions from top to bottom, the Sultanate may yet survive into the modern era as a Great Power, or at least as a respectable state."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.2.OPT1: "One can only hope it is not too late..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.3.T: "Stagnating Economy"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.3.D: "While the Ottoman Empire grew rich on trade and production of luxury goods, the timar system by which they governed their vast empire proved an obstacle to further economic development. This semi-feudal system led to an increasingly strong focus on agricultural productivity at the expense of investing in the industry, which in any case was stifled by the inflexible land divisions. This results in weak economic growth and increasing difficulty keeping up with the industrial powers of Europe."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.3.OPT1: "I'm not seeing the problem..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.4.T: "Illiterate Populace"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.4.D: "Due to a variety of factors, including an emphasis on war and the officer class, Ottoman society began to lack greatly behind the Western Powers in terms of education. Hovering between 5% and 10% total literacy, the Ottomans increasingly became unable to keep up with the rest of Europe in technological innovation and business methods."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.4.OPT1: "We need to educate the kids who can't read well..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.5.T: "Failures of the Timar System"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.5.D: "The Timar system served the Ottoman Empire well in its initial years of expansion when taxation was the primary source of income for most governments and recruiting soldiers for war was the Ottomans' top priority. Now, this system is rapidly becoming outmoded. Worse, the declining control of the Sublime Porte has allowed the Timars to begin exploiting the land for their short-term gain rather than effectively managing it. This deprived the Ottoman state of a stable, long-term revenue source. In addition, this also forced peasants off their lands and into cities, simultaneously reducing the number of productive rural workers while increasing the dependency of the city for food."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.5.OPT1: "Unfortunate..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.6.T: "Debasing Currency"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.6.D: "As the economic situation of the empire continued to deteriorate, the Sultanate began to devalue its currency to pay its armies and bureaucracy. However, even worse were the provincial governors doing the same thing. Free from any personal consequences to themselves from the general decline in value, they freely printed and minted worthless coinage to enrich themselves at the expense of the Empire."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.6.OPT1: "These Jackals will be the end of us!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.7.T: "The Decline of Ottoman Trade Dominance"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.7.D: "Once the sole arbiter of trade between Asia, Africa, and Europe, the Ottomans grew wealthy on monopolizing trade. However, the rise of colonialism has rendered most of the ancient overland trade routes to Asia obsolete, and even the vaunted Red Sea route has begun to decline as new routes to India, along with trade from the New World, leave Ottoman traders behind. What was once a geographically advantageous position, dominating the Mediterranean, has become a geographic prison."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.7.OPT1: "We shall recover... eventually!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.8.T: "More Economic Downturn"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.8.D: "From its inception, the Ottoman Sultanate was a warlike state with its priority firmly on a strong army and expansionism rather than the development of a home economy. In the era when spoils were more common, the armies could often be paid by such spoils. As the Ottomans ran out of easy expansion routes, however, the lack of economic growth began to snowball as the army became more expensive. Now that we are on the back foot militarily, the situation has only gotten worse. We must either invest in our industry or find new conquests... or both."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.8.OPT1: "If a shark does not swim, it sinks..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.9.T: "Celali Revolts"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.9.D: "The increasing instability and economic decline have led to anarchy in much of the countryside nominally part of the empire. The discontent with the lack of adequate food, the failure to maintain law and order, and the resentment against the Sultan and his lords alike, have led to simmering anger for quite some time. \n\nNow, a radical traveling Shi'ite cleric, known only as Celal, has whipped the already angry people into a fury. The Celali revolts, as they came to be called, were ostensibly a religious uprising but were more an expression of general discontent."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.9.OPT1: "Dispatch the Army and crush them!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.10.T: "Price Controls"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.10.D: "As food becomes scarcer, merchants often feel as if they have no choice but to gouge the starving peasants clamoring to buy their bread. A debate among the viziers has broken out about how to address this. Some insist that the only morally right option is to put in price controls to alleviate the poor's suffering, while others say that the potential ruin of the traders helps no one. While price controls may alleviate poverty and starvation, the ripple effect on the economy at large could theoretically be catastrophic."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.10.OPT1: "Bread must be at a fair price!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.10.OPT2: "We must not interfere with the merchants!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.10.OPT3: "We will buy the bread ourselves and distribute it to the people!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.11.T: "Corrupt Landholding"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.11.D: "As part of the Sublime Porte's method of governing its vast domains, large... tracts of land were handed off to various noble houses and mosques as theirs to govern on behalf of the Sultan. The greed that inevitably resulted in reduced incomes and increased privatization of land taxes has plagued the empire since its inception. Now, however, as other problems come to the forefront, this problem has become more prominent, as well as getting worse in the confusion."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.11.OPT1: "There was nothing to be done..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.11.OPT2: "We must arrest those responsible!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.12.T: "Balkan Separatism"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.12.D: "The Sublime Porte has always ruled over an uneasy mixture of peoples, religions, and subject nations. Despite claims by the Sultans and their supporters both here and abroad, the relationship of our Balkan subjects to us in particular has always been one of master and servant. Tired of religious discrimination, foreign high taxes, and forced conscription into the Sultanate's army, many have grown to bitterly resent their second-class citizen status. \n\nIn our moment of weakness, these diverse populations have begun to set wheels in motion to bring about their independence and our downfall..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.12.OPT1: "Only time will tell what this may bring..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.13.T: "Hungarian Separatism"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.13.D: "More than just simply one of the many ethnicities of our empire, Hungarians under our rule remember the days when they were a powerful rival to the Ottomans in their own right. Our rivals have taken advantage of this, sowing separatist sentiment in old Hungarian lands..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.13.OPT1: "Okay."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.14.T: "Croat Resistance"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.14.D: "When the Ottoman Empire made its initial rapid advance across the Balkans, the small but old and proud Christian kingdom of Croatia made a stubborn stand which halted the empire's progress for years. Now, the memory of these "heroes," combined with our current weakness, has encouraged a new generation of Croats to take up arms against us..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.14.OPT1: "That's all we needed..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.15.T: "Romanian Uprising"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.15.D: "Although a nation known as "Rumania" has never existed, and did not exist when we conquered the people now known as Romanians, that has not stopped them from dreaming of a nation-state of their own."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.15.OPT1: "How dare they..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.16.T: "Bulgarian Awakening"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.16.D: "Since the HRE-backed revolts of 1408, Bulgaria has long been one of the most tranquil parts of the empire. Thankfully so, its proximity to Konstantiniyye made it especially critical to the empire's infrastructure and military. \n\nIn this new age, however, the wave of national consciousness sweeping the Balkans has awakened long-dormant separatism in Bulgaria once again. An illicit book by an Orthodox monk titled the Istoriya Slavyabolgarskaya (The Slavonic Bulgarian History) has sparked a "National Awakening." The most radical of these have already begun taking up arms against us, but more are sure to follow..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.16.OPT1: "Crush them!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.17.T: "Great Bosnian Uprising"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.17.D: "Although efforts to Turkify and convert the Bosnian population to Islam have met with greater success than elsewhere in the Balkans, this has done little to dim the nationalism and independence fervor sweeping the region. Several prominent nobles have raised armies demanding independence."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.17.OPT1: "Fools! They will be dealt with..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.18.T: "Serbian Revolution"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.18.D: "The Serbs, long poised on the frontier between the Ottomans and their rivals, enjoyed a particular degree of autonomy. This, however, has not endeared them to us. Far from it, in fact! The autonomy they enjoy has only given them a taste of full independence. In addition, new ideas of constitutionalism and equal rights have taken root here more than in many places in the empire. Combined with separatist, religious, and local elites' forces, we have a perfect storm brewing..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.18.OPT1: "No one can remove us!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.19.T: "Ottoman Superiority Questioned"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.19.D: "In the earlier ages, when Ottoman superiority over both the kafirs in Europe and our enemies elsewhere was undeniable, there was little reason to question our ways. Now that the rest of the world has caught up, with some rumors even saying we have fallen behind, murmurs among the elite threaten to depose this image of superiority. If we decide to heed these seditious voices, we may be able to learn from our enemies and reverse our defeats. However, this could threaten the already-teetering structure of the empire..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.19.OPT1: "Nothing an infidel can come up with can match our glorious empire!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.19.OPT2: "We can learn from our enemies as well as inevitably defeat them."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.20.T: "Contacts with the West"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.20.D: "As the Ottoman Empire is in decline, a small sector of the elites have chosen to send their children to study in Europe rather than immersing them in our ways. Now, these young men are returning to the Sublime Porte filled with marvelous tales about technological advancements, new cultural achievements, and new ideas of governance from the West. For now, they are few and pose no threat, should we determine these notions are, in fact, threatening. We may choose to risk these ideas to create a more flexible, and thus durable, society. Alternatively, the clergy warns against these infidel ideas, and after all the new politics that come with them may undermine our Islamic Empire..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.20.OPT1: "Encourage more openness with the West!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.20.OPT2: "We must not allow these heathen ideas to disturb the Caliphate."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.21.T: "Famine in the Cities"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.21.D: "The ongoing revolts have had multiple deleterious effects on the Sublime Porte's ability to feed its people. While peasants fleeing the violence and corrupt landlords are flooding into our cities, those same events are preventing us from bringing in enough food to even feed those already residing there. The grim reaper of urban famine, with its close companion, plague, has followed the peasants into the cities. Soon the promised safety of the walls became a prison. Despairing of their lot in life, these peasants have now turned violent..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.21.OPT1: "Alas that these evil days should be mine!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.22.T: "Decadent Ruling Classes"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.22.D: "Even in its hour of need, it is becoming clear that the Sublime Porte cannot rely on its ruling classes for help. Indeed, their decadence has in large part contributed to our decline. With each passing year nobility and clergy alike become less loyal to the Sultan. Many have carved out private fiefdoms for themselves and pay next to no tribute to the capital."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.22.OPT1: "We have no choice but to give them free rein."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.22.OPT2: "We must stop this!"

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.23.T: "Rise of the Hayduks"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.23.D: "Taking advantage of the chaos in the Balkans, a sharp increase in the number of armed bandits has plagued commerce and troop movements. Hailed by our enemies as "freedom fighters", we who have to deal with them know they are nothing more than brigands."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.23.OPT1: "Unbelievable..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.24.T: "Greek Revolts!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.24.D: "Ever since the dawn of Greek separatism, there have been sporadic claims made to restore a Greek nation-state. Although centuries of plotting have been kept from boiling over by various means, the new-found weakness of the Ottoman state has given Greek revolutionaries the perfect opportunity. Rising under the leadership of Ioannis Kapodistrias, a Greek diplomat in the service of Venice, the Greeks claim to be reclaiming their ancient freedoms and democracy from our supposed "tyranny.\""
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.24.OPT1: "Let them fight for their "freedom" and see how much it costs them..."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.25.T: "Greece Declares Independence!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.25.D: "After centuries of domination by the Ottomans, the Greeks have finally struck out to reclaim their place as an independent nation. Should we ally with this new state and help them to secure their freedom?"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.25.OPT1: "The Greeks must be liberated!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.25.OPT2: "Let the Turks handle their affairs."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.26.T: "Serbia Declares Independence!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.26.D: "Tired of foreign rule and yearning for self-governance and liberty, our Serbian Orthodox brethren have thrown off the Ottoman yoke and are attempting to win their independence. As our little Slavic brethren as well as fellow Orthodox Christians, some say we must help in any way we can. Should we help them secure their freedom?"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.26.OPT1: "We must help them remove Ottomans."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.26.OPT2: "We cannot get involved directly, but they have our support in men and equipment."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.26.OPT3: "This is not our problem."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.27.T: "Rampant Corruption"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.27.D: "As the Sublime Porte continues to weaken in its grip over its subjects, more and more people turn to unofficial channels to conduct their affairs. Increasingly they turn to bribery, nepotism, and crime to get what they need. While this greases the wheels in the short run, the current avalanche of corruption will prove crippling to the empire in the long term. While other matters demand our attention, this too must become a priority if we are to save the ship of state."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.27.OPT1: "Devote as many resources as possible to stop this!"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.27.OPT2: "We cannot focus on this right now."

  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.28.T: "Egypt Demands Autonomy"
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.28.D: "While the Ottomans conquered Egypt at lightning speed in the 16th century, this meant that many of the local power holders there still held onto power, simply under new management. While the Empire remained strong, the Egyptians remained loyal, if by fear more than anything else. In the process, they became an integral part of the empire's economic base. The outsized wealth wielded by Egyptian pashas, as well as the region never being as fully integrated under Ottoman rule, proved a recipe for instability when the rest of the empire began ailing. \nNow, the heads of the most powerful old Mamluk families, along with the governing Pashas, have approached the Sultan himself demanding self-governance in internal affairs and economic autonomy. While this bold request was unthinkable a generation ago, this may be unavoidable in the current state of the empire."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.28.OPT1: "We have no choice..."
  disaster_fee_decline_of_the_ottomans.28.OPT2: "We will not back down!"

 # Hasburg Monarchy
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.1.T: "Division of the Habsburg Monarchy"
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.1.D: "Starting in the 1400s, the Habsburg family sought to cement their rise to power by moving away from their tradition of dividing up their realm among multiple heirs and towards a primogeniture system. However, the ancient inheritance laws are still legally enforceable. Ensuring that the ever-increasing Habsburg possessions remained united has taken astute management and a firm grip. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has not been blessed with such an ability, and thus other branches of House von Habsburg have begun to assert their old rights. While this would, of course, benefit them, it threatens the fledgling Habsburg empire with division and ultimately dissolution."
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.1.OPT1: "All in the family..."

  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.2.T: "Reunification!"
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.2.D: "At long last, the dream of reuniting the Habsburg monarchy has been achieved. The antiquated laws that threatened to leave the realm in tatters have been finally quashed. Now, we emerge from the chaos stronger for it. A modernized nation-state rather than the feudal monarchy we were."
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.2.OPT1: "A.E.I.O.U."

  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.3.T: "The Stem Duchy of [STY.GetName]"
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.3.D: "Long the heart of the Habsburg domain, the title of Duke of [STY.GetName] has often been the most important stepping stone to the headship of the Habsburg dynasty, and lately to the title of Holy Roman Emperor itself. Contrary to EU4's usual representation of a united Austria in 1444, it was the ruler from Steiermark, not Vienna, who was Holy Roman Emperor in 1444 and would remain so through 1457."
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.3.OPT1: "It is our law..."
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.3.OPT2: "If he wants to claim his throne he shall have to fight for it!"

  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.4.D: "The long-absent Lords of [STY.GetName], believed by many to be the rightful ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, has now thrown off rule from [From.Capital.GetName]. Shall we support their claim to the Imperial Throne?"
  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.4.OPT1: "The throne belongs to §Y[STY.GetName]§!!"

  disaster_fee_division_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.6.D: "The majority of the Electors have chosen to support §Y[STY.GetName]§!. Not only did they in war, but also the Empire. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been overthrown and is no longer the Holy Roman Emperor!"

It's powerful armies, wealthy mines, and rich lands offer perhaps the most tempting prize of all. Our late ruler, however, ruled that his youngest son Maximilian should be the one to inherit it. This keeps it out of the hands of the more grasping brothers, but leaves the Hungarian throne in the hands of a child ruler, and therefore vulnerable.

However, the antiquated succession law's have left Frederick's beloved Austria a pale shadow of its former self. Now, the shattered Archduchy must rally to fulfill its goal. A choice remains.

While the Turco-Mongol invaders themselves are no longer the ruling dynasty, a class of foreign Pashtun nobles has never fully lost its influence. With the failure of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to either pacify or curtail these nobles, they have begun to mobilize their influence to once again take control of [Root.GetName] for themselves. Their chosen [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], a brother of the current, now leads men in open revolt. \n\n[Root.GetName] has weathered much instability in its past and always recovered, but this may prove its greatest test.

  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.3.D: "The instability sweeping the [Root.GovernmentName], as well as the diversion of the state treasury to deal with constant revolts, has led to a breakdown of the overland trade routes that are the lifeblood of [Root.GetName]'s economy. Plagued by bandits, many of its famous trade highways lie all but desolate, while merchants ply coasts further south in search of better profits.

Because of this, a willingness to revolt that was previously unknown has spread throughout the realm. This is especially strong in the border provinces of the Empire, with far less affinity for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] than peoples closer to the Imperial City itself have had."
  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.6.OPT1: "Ingrates! I brought peace, justice, and freedom to my empire!"

  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.7.T: "Autocracy Rejected"
  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.7.D: "As one of the many grievances listed for the revolt, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s autocratic tendencies and attempts to increase centralized control were especially prominent in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rejection by the nobles. While those already in open revolt must either be surrendered to or put down by force, those still considering rebellion might be pacified if the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] reverses course."

  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.8.T: "Popular Uprising"
  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.8.D: "Since its birth in 1206, the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName], from succession to tax collection, has been founded primarily on military strength rather than either popular support, religious legitimacy, or any other more traditional means. Of course, in situations like our current disaster when the military strength of the [Root.GovernmentName] is sapped, the discontented people now take their opportunity to attempt their own overthrow. Some wish simply to bring down the regime, but some even attempt to bring about religious regime change. Taking advantage of the chaos, they have managed to raise an army against us."

  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.9.T: "Bureaucracy Collapses"
  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.9.D: "The administration of [Root.GetName] was never a paragon of efficiency, but without a strong ruler or during times of crisis, it utterly collapsed. Taxes were left unpaid, censuses unconducted, and the court became ever more nepotistic as the societal structure broke down."

  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.11.D: "Spearheading the civil war in [From.GetName] are our distant cousins the Pashtun nobles of Hindustan. The ties of kinship run deep, and many in the court lent a sympathetic ear when a delegation of these nobles arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] to beseech our aid. Despite our ties, mobilizing in their support is risky, and after all we owe them nothing... However, this could present an opportunity..."

  disaster_fee_pashtun_uprising.12.D: "As a culturally [From.GetAdjective] class living among Hindustanis, the Pasthun nobility have never forgotten their roots. Because of this, they found a sympathetic ear in the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] for their rebellion. So sympathetic, in fact, that [From.GetName] now marches to war against us on their behalf!"

  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.1.D: "In the 18th century, the Empire of Ethiopia went through a period of numerous conflicts within its own borders. Having defeated it's rivals, the Empire was helpless against factions led by various princes of the realm as each sought to fight each other for power while the Emperor increasingly had little authority outside the capital. \n\nThe development of both culture and society stagnated during this period; additionally, it was time of increased religious strife both within the Coptic Orthodox Ethiopian Church as well as between Chrstians and Muslims in the realm."

  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.3.T: "Princes Demand the Right to Rule"
  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.3.D: "Even at the worst, the ruling dynasty of [Root.GetName] maintained a near-legendary status, being chosen directly by God in the minds of both commoner and noble. While the integrity of the dynasty was never questioned, many of the local princes claimed divine ordination in their own right, and were willing to seize such right to rule by force during this period."

  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.3.OPT3: "Give in to their demands."

  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.4.T: "Succession Crisis"
  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.4.D: "While none seriously questioned the right of the ruling dynasty to rule, [Root.GetName]'s complex succession system was prey to there being numerous contenders from within the same royal house. In a period of instability, noble factions often supported one contender over another with the implicit promise, that, once in power, they would be favorites."
  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.4.OPT1: "How dare they?"

  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.5.T: "Rise of Empress Mentewab"
  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.5.D: "Faced with the lack of imperial authority, the Queen Mother of the latest Emperor has risen to prominence in [Root.Capital.GetName]. In an unprecedented move, she has requested the Patriarch to be crowned Empress to ensure the continuing stability of the empire.

  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.7.D: "In a stunning turn of events that rocked not only the capital but sent shock-waves throughout East Africa, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was brutally killed in the palace today. Prior to this period of conflict, this was unheard of in the empire. News of the first killings, indeed, sparked a national outcry that anyone would raise a hand against the Lord's Annointed. Now, however, with different factions vying for the throne this only opens the floodgates to further killings and unrest."

  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.8.D: "With their belief that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was God's Chosen, it was only natural that the European philosophy of absolutism found open ears in [Root.GetName]. However, this theory seems increasingly unworkable during the current conflict."

  disaster_fee_zemene_mesafint.9.D: "While none aspired to seize the formal title of Emperor, there were families who wished to rule in all but name.

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.1.D: "Not since the days of Chandragupta has any empire laid such a legitimate claim to Master of India. However, the Great Mughal Empire now faces a crisis. The actions of [Root.Monarch.GetName] have been inadequate and indeed outright harmful to the rule over India. Discontent has spread like wildfire, and the decay of the once-peerless Mughal administration has undermined the very foundations of the empire. Without strong leadership, none can claim to rule India."

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.3.T: "Disloyalty in the Army"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.3.D: "Once a disciplined and awe-inspiring force, the [Root.GetAdjective] armies have become weak and defective. The old levy system, which inspired fierce loyalty and made organization easy in the early days of the empire, proved inadequate to face the challenges of large-scale imperial rule. The nobles who once proved capable leaders have become decadent and selfish, the distance between the capital and the front weakened the bonds that once united soldier and emperor, and scheming nobles began to use their contingents as personal retinues at the expense of Imperial effectiveness."
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.3.OPT1: "We don't have time for this..."

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.4.T: "Discontent Among the Hindu"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.4.D: "The [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] was founded on religious tolerance of the Dharmic faiths. It would not, in fact, be unfair to say that the empire could never have even began without the generous privileges granted to the Hindu and Sikh faiths by Akbar and other early emperor. Later rulers, however, seemed to have forgotten that most of their population were not followers of Islam. Reimposing the hated jizya tax, barring Hindus from coveted court positions, attempting forcible conversion, and even burning temples, they quickly turned the people against them."
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.4.OPT1: "They are only kafir..."

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.5.T: "Degeneration of the Nobility"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.5.D: "The original military ruling class of the empire were hardened Afghani warriors. Their descendants are shadows of that former glory. Lulled by the wealth and leisure of India, they became slothful, and debauched. Many spent more time in their harems than anywhere else, and felt no need nor loyalty to aid the empire as a whole."
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.5.OPT1: "Disgraceful!"

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.6.T: "Economic Collapse"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.6.D: "While the peace and stability of the early empire brought relative prosperity, the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] had never truly encouraged economic growth. Focusing on the urban centers that made and sold luxury goods abroad, the administration mostly ignored the rest of the country, treating it as a source of quick tax revenue. This caused a wider economic stagnation, but recent tax increases by an increasingly desperate imperial treasury have instigated full-on economic collapse. Demanding as much as one-half of the harvest, tax collectors caused farmers to overwork the land leading to soil depletion, and the [Root.GetAdjective] treasury began for the first time in its history to consider bankruptcy."
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.6.OPT1: "What else could we do?"

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.7.T: "[Root.GetAdjective] Peasants Rise Up"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.7.D: "The [Root.GetAdjective] dynasty relied heavily on the taxation of harvests directly from the farming castes. Not only did this disproportionately affect and impoverish the farmers, but also was subject to the whims of climate and weather. The instability of the empire combined with poverty from these taxes has finally pushed the peasantry passed the breaking point. Forming into roving bands of robbers, they react against the law and order of the empire."

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.8.T: "Jains Demand Support"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.8.D: "The Jains, although a small religious minority, proved a vital part of the [Root.GetAdjective]'s extensive administration. As money managers, loan offerors, and bankers, their support was needed more than ever in hard times. \n\nFeeling insecure in their positions and our ability to pay as instability engulfs the empire, the Jains have confronted us demanding that we pay them upfront for their services."

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.9.D: "In addition to creating fragmentation and competing loyalties, the overgrown levy system has resulted in the soldiery, many of whom are essentially mercenaries, to not be paid. Because of this, the army increasingly lacks fighting morale as well as discipline."
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.9.OPT1: "Dogs!"

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.10.T: "Lack of Officers"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.10.D: "The decadence of the nobility has resulted in a shortage of good officers. In addition, many of those who were capable have been killed, either on the battlefield or as the result of vile plots from jealous rivals."

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.11.T: "Rajput Rebellion"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.11.D: "One of the more astute moves of the early emperors, in addition to tolerance of the Hindus, was their respect for and working relationship with the Rajputs. Later rulers, however, sought to reduce the Rajputs' independence. A foolish move, for the Rajputs still controlled much of the Indian armed forces. Now, they seek full independence for themselves!"

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.12.T: "Sharia Restrictions Backfire"
  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.12.D: "The hard-line Islamic rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has not only angered the non-Muslims of the realm, of which there are plenty. In fact, the harsh rules supported by radical clerics go so far as to ban many cultural activities. The use of musical instruments, the performance of theater, and even the musical recitation of Islamic poetry has all been attacked by the clergy, and [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s actions to ban these things have made even most Muslims rebel against the harsh new way of life."

  disaster_fee_crisis_of_the_mughal_empire.14.D: "Unlike other older states, the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] lacked a set rule of succession and ignored primogeniture. While this could result in more capable rulers overall, it also risked succession crises and disputes. During times like this of instability, pretenders are more rife than ever."

  disaster_fee_netherlands_rampjaar.3.D: "Discontent with the dire situation of the Netherlands has led to a search for scapegoat among the populace. The incompetent rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] made both him and his cabinet a natural target of the people's anger. A plot was quickly devised to rid the nation of their influence. Using a staged peasant revolt as a diversion to distract the Stadtholder's guards, [Root.Monarch.GetName] as well as his brother were seized by a gathered crowd in [Root.Capital.GetName], including the town militia. \nFollowing their seizure by the mob, an unanticipated and truly ghastly scene unfolded, as the brothers were brutally murdered by the mob. Their naked, mutilated bodies were then strung up and paraded by the crowd, and their livers were even eaten by the mob in a cannibalistic frenzy. Through it all, the mob remained remarkably organized and disciplined, leading many to doubt that such a scene, horrid as it was, could have been unplanned. This realization prompted the entire cabinet to flee the country in fear for their own lives. This event would be remembered as one of the darkest hours in Dutch history."

  disaster_fee_naples_conspiracy_barons.1.D: "In the land of Naples, the king sought to bring about a great change. He wished to dissolve the feudal ways and make his royal power the sole force in the land. But the barons, proud and powerful, stood in his way. They opposed the king's plans for an "organic reform of the state", which sought to reduce their power and promote new entrepreneurs to the ruling class. The king sought to use fiscal reform to break free from the feudal weight, but it was a difficult task. For out of 1550 inhabited centers, only a little more than 100 were under the direct control of the king and the court. The rest were controlled by the barons, who held the resources and finances of the kingdom. The king favored the extension of state-owned cities, but the barons were organized into powerful dynasties that controlled more lands than the king. The Orsini Del Balzo, the Sanseverinos, the Acquaviva, the Caldora, the Caracciolos, the Guevara, and the Senerchia were the elite in power, suffocating the kingdom. The clash between the king and the barons was inevitable, for they stood in opposition to the very soul of his vision."

The barons, proud and fierce, clashed with King Ferrante, seeking to hold onto their power and lands. But the king was not alone, for he had called upon many Italian captains to aid him in his struggle. And among them was Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu, a hero of the Albanian people, who led a contingent of 1000 infantry and 700 knights across the Adriatic to fight for the king. In this war, there were great losses and bitter defeats. Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo, the last prince of Taranto, met his end in Altamura in [GetYear], some say at the hands of the king himself. And Antonio Caldora, duke of Bari, was captured during the siege of Vasto and stripped of all his possessions. The Orsini del Balzo lost their vast territory, which was confiscated by the court. And the Caldora, who had lost all their lands and possessions, never rose again. The barons were humbled, and the king was victorious. With his power secured, King Ferrante set about enacting new laws to weaken the baronial class and strengthen the state. The state-owned cities grew, and the king reorganized the economic and commercial life of the kingdom. For a time, the barons were subject to the royal initiative. Thus ended the war of 1459-[GetYear], a hard-fought battle that left many scars. But in the end, the king emerged triumphant, and the kingdom was forever changed."

  disaster_fee_naples_conspiracy_barons.10.T: "Seconda Congiura dei Baroni"
  disaster_fee_naples_conspiracy_barons.10.D: "In 1485, a secretive conspiracy unfolded in the realm of Salerno, led by Prince Antonello Sanseverino. Advised by Antonello Petrucci, Francesco Coppola, and Luigi Gesualdo da Caggiano, they united various feudal families and barons of the Guelph faction, loyal to the Angevins. These nobles included the Caracciolo, Gesualdo, Del Balzo, Guevara, Senerchia, Caldora, and Sienese barons. \nThe barons gathered in Melfi expressed discontent but were cautious, not willing to act against Alfonso immediately due to the painful memory of a previous defeat. Girolamo Sanseverino was assigned to explore possible alliances and negotiate with the king. Meanwhile, Coppola played a double game, offering himself as an intermediary to King Ferrante while secretly aligning with the conspirators. His strategy aimed to secure a prominent position among the barons if they decided to dethrone the current dynasty. \nIn this intricate political landscape, alliances shifted, loyalties wavered, and the fate of the realm hung in the balance."

  disaster_fee_naples_conspiracy_barons.11.D: "In a twist of fate, King [Root.Monarch.GetName] thwarted the plans of Coppola and Petrucci, who had underestimated his cunning. The king pretended to support Coppola's proposal while secretly using him as an agent within the conspiracy. He rewarded Coppola with honors and positions but continued to pursue his own agenda alongside his son Alfonso. \nThe conspirators' scheme involved barring the king from traveling through territories near the capital, isolating Naples. They hoped to bring in Papal and other reinforcements from the border between the Papal State and the Abruzzi. This plot also involved allies like John II of Lorraine and Roberto Sanseverino. \nThe climax unfolded in the [GetYear], within the Castel of [Root.Capital.GetName]. King [Root.Monarch.GetName] lured the conspirators into a trap, inviting them under the pretense of celebrating his niece's wedding. Instead, they were arrested and met their end."

 # Vijayaba Kollaya
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.1.T: "Palace Coup!"
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.1.D: "While the decision to place [Root.Heir.GetName] as next in line to the throne was an essential part of royal life in the court of [Root.GetName], there were a number of other heirs who sensed weakness in [Root.Monarch.GetName] and seek to stake their own claim to the throne. Each of them supported by their own mother, as each are sons of different royal wives and concubines, the lesser princes have conspired to murder the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Needless to say, simply removing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not secure one's own claim, and each prince secretly mustered mercenaries and levies to prepare for the war they committed to bringing about. Now, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is dead, slain by the hand of mercenary assassins, and civil war is upon us."
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.1.OPT1: "Death to Traitors!"

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.3.T: "Collapse of [Root.GetName]"
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.3.D: "With the death of the last [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] and the triumph of the rebellious princes, the nation was thoroughly devastated by war. Because of that, while the princes had initially fought one another for control of the whole realm, none now wanted further bloodshed to deal with each other now that their common enemy lay dead. Because of that, it was decided amongst the pretenders to divide the kingdom amongst themselves, with each of them getting roughly equal lands."
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.3.OPT1: "We went quietly into that night..."

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.4.T: "Kingdom Triumphant"
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.4.D: "Despite all adversities, the power of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has prevailed over the rebellious princes and their supporters. The pretender princes were all stripped of their personal estates and banished forever, saved solely because royal blood could not be spilled by any loyal servant of the crown. The most prominent government ministers and nobles who supported them, however, had no such rights. The highest-ranking ones were publicly executed, and many mid-tier nobles who provided the most support in money and manpower were stripped of their castes and relegated to the lowly occupation of cutting grass for elephants' food."
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.4.OPT1: "Peace at last!"

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.5.T: "Soldiers defect to Princes!"
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.5.D: "While the minor princes contending for the throne against [Root.Monarch.GetName] have thus far largely relied on foreign mercenaries, they have also not been idle seeking support among the ranks of the royal army. Now, a sizable fraction of those troops have not shown up for duty, conveying to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that they are refusing to take up arms against the princes. Citing a long-standing aversion to shed royal blood, the reality is clear: they either support one prince or another outright, or they simply do not want to risk the repercussions of fighting against a potentially winning side. Either way, they are gone, and with our limited resources, we have no choice but to let them go."
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.5.OPT1: "Curses!"

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.6.D.1: "Just as the princes who started this war started it by palace intrigue, so the ministers of our government have engaged in intrigue of their own. Recently, it has come to light that the assassination of our late [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was aided by none other than [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]. Not only was [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] aware of the plot and failed to assist the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], as is [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] duty, but actively gave hidden support to the princes behind it."

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.7.D: "In addition to the princes who have taken up arms against the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], other potential candidates for the throne exist. One of them, a nephew of the late [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], was a personal favorite of several of the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ministers and advisors. One of them, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Master of the Horse, has not been idle, mustering an army of his own in a peripheral province far from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s distracted eye. In the dead of night, he and his supporters took the prince, galloped into the night and raised the banner of rebellion for their own claim to the royal throne."
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.7.OPT1: "How dare they?!"

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.8.T: "A Counter Plot is Hatched"
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.8.D: "In the aftermath of the death of the late [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the subsequent revolt of the princes, the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has learned much of the ways of court intrigue. In an attempt to try and end the civil war the other princes have brought about, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has hatched a counter-plot. In essence, the plan is to lure the princes into the royal palace with the prospect of peace negotiations, have a set of chosen loyal soldiers bar the doors, and simply massacre all the princes involved in the rebellion. Without the head, the snake dies..."
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.8.OPT1: "Go through with the plot."
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.8.OPT2: "It's too risky..."

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.9.T: "Success!"
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.9.D: "It was a plot worthy of the cunningness of the tiger. The princes never suspected a thing as the wooden bars of the palace doors slid into place behind them. The soldiers then rushed in upon them and brutally stabbed and slashed them all to death, leaving a gory scene in their wake. When the heads of the traitors were displayed on pikes on the palace walls, their stunned troops surrounding the city had no idea what to do next. Without a cause, the generals attempted to retreat their armies and determine whether to continue the struggle, but as they marched through the jungle, their ranks quickly thinned from desertions until the armies were no more. The civil war has been won in one swift stroke."
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.9.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.10.T: "Counter-Plot Backfires!"
 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.10.D: "Rather than being cunning like the tiger, our plan turned out to have been foolish beyond all comprehension. As the princes entered the palace with a large portion of their armies just outside, one of the youngest princes, only 6 years of age, innocently told the rebellious princes his brothers about the soldiers stationed at the doors. Alarmed, they rushed out and alerted their forces of our supposed treachery. Enraged, their troops stormed the palace, while the princes addressed the populace, stirring them up against their rightful ruler."

 disaster_fee_vijayaba_kollaya.11.D: "The armies of the pretenders, combined with aggrieved peasants and disloyal rabble, have breached the capital defenses and overrun the city. As the enemy soldiers storm through the palace, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has locked [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in an upper palace room with only a few concubines. Meanwhile out in the city, order was eventually restored amongst the soldiery, but the peasantry proved less controllable. Rampaging through the streets, all the priceless treasures of the capital were pilfered, broken, scattered through the streets, and thoroughly pillaged. \n\nEventually, the princes decided that the king, who they labeled as a dishonorable traitor, was to die. None of their troops would dare shed royal blood, until a foreign mercenary volunteered for the task. With the head of the last [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] displayed to the troops, it seems the civil war might finally be drawing to an end..."
