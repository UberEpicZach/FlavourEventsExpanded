 FEE_Mewar_Events.1.T: "Erection of the Vijay Stambah"
 FEE_Mewar_Events.1.D: "To celebrate the glorious victory of our army and the capture of Sultan Mahmoud Khalji of Malwa during the Battle of Sarangpur, our esteemed Lord, [Root.Monarch.GetName], has decreed the erection of a grand Stambha (pillar) within the fortified walls of Chittor Fort. This magnificent pillar, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, will bear intricate engravings that trace the illustrious lineage of the Sisodia Clan, ensuring that our tales of conquest and the valour of our soldiers will outlive the mortal human body and echo through eternity. In a gesture of unity and respect for our Jain subjects, an icon of the Jain Goddess, Padmavati, will adorn the roof of the monument. This inclusion symbolises the harmony and respect we hold for all beliefs under our rule. This mighty Stambha will not only stand as a testament to the pride and indomitable spirit of the Rajput warriors but also as a beacon of our unyielding power. It will strike fear into the hearts of those who dare to challenge us and serve as a striking reminder to the Hindus of Mewar that as long as the Sisodias reign, not even a fly can harm them. The grand pillar will rise above Chittor Fort, a symbol of our eternal strength and the unwavering might of our dynasty, celebrating our victories and safeguarding our legacy for generations to come."

 FEE_Mewar_Events.2.T: "The Siege of Chittorgarh"
 FEE_Mewar_Events.2.D: "On the first day of the Kartika, 1489 ([GetDateText]), Mughal batteries opened fire upon the mighty fortress of Chittorgarh. Akbar, the Mughal Emperor, considered the fort of Chittor a thorn in his side, hindering further expansion in the Deccan. To add to his frustration, the Maharana, Udai Singh II, provided refuge to the Afghan rebel leader Baz Bahadur. The Sisodia treasury had been exhausted following a long war with Gujarat and sustaining a prolonged war with the grand Mughal Army seemed impossible. Heeding the advice of the Royal Council, the Maharana and his family fled towards the city of Udaipur, leaving the fort with a garrison of 8,000 troops under the leadership of Jaimal Rathore and Fateh Singh. Emperor Akbar further incited religious fervour, calling for all Muslims to join the 'Jihad' against the 'infidels'.\n\nDespite being severely outnumbered, the besieged Rajputs fought like tigers. Every attempt the Mughals made to tear down the walls of the fortress and assault its defenders bore no fruit. Any breaches were subsequently repaired overnight, much to the dismay of the Mughal Commanders. The mighty Jalalluddin himself evaded death by a hair's margin. After reinforcement of cannons were brought from all over the Empire, did the Mughals finally succeed in a coordinated assault on the fort. While aiding with the repairs, Jaimal Rathore was mortally wounded from a musket shot by the Shahenshah-e-Hind. As the Ghazi's troops fought their way into the heart of the bastion, they realised that their sheer numbers were matched only by the stubbornness of the Mewari soldiers. On the auspicious day of Holi, the few remaining saffron-clad warriors under the leadership of the young Fateh Singh fought bravely, albeit in vain to defend the final inches of the fort. Horrified by their inevitable fate, Rajput women, young, old and infant, in their silver ghagras stepped into pyres, creating an almost beautiful scene of devastation and hopelessness.\n\nThe five month long siege had ended, with the fort's entire garrison slain. Its once bustling streets had been reduced to rubble and corpses lined every corner. The Conquest of Chittor, even though extremely costly in terms of both money and manpower, allowed the Mughals to easily expand into the remaining territories of the Sisodias. Sticking true to their nature however, many Rajputs rallied to the war of resistance led by Maharana Pratap. While they would be martyred in the attempt, their valour would inspire opposition to Mughal rule for generations to come."

 FEE_Mewar_Events.3.T: "Desert Diplomacy"
 FEE_Mewar_Events.3.D: "The desert is often a desolate and morbid place, but it can also be a stunningly beautiful landscape, especially during sunrise, sunset, and under the night sky. The amazing colours of the sky, contrasted with the warm glow of the sand, create an almost magical scene. As the sun dips below the horizon, the sand shimmers golden, and the sky bursts into a spectacular display of reds, pinks, and purples. Sitting in this sea of gold, watching the sun's descent, is a sight like no other. As night falls, the brief darkness reveals a vast black void adorned with thousands of stars that shimmer like diamonds against a black velvet cloth. It is in this enchanting setting that we welcome our esteemed visitors, foreign dignitaries, and rulers. Under the fading light of the setting sun, a richly set table offers the most royal of foods, inviting guests to indulge in a feast fit for kings. As the stars begin to twinkle, the meal transitions to hot coffee or spiced tea, sipped under the starlit sky. This tradition has left even the most extravagant of emperors in awe. The combination of the desert's natural beauty and our warm hospitality creates an unforgettable experience, one that lingers in the hearts of all who witness it."

 FEE_Mewar_Events.4.T: "The Rathore Rajputs"
 FEE_Mewar_Events.4.D: "The Rathore Rajputs, renowned for their valor and military prowess, instituted a national martial code that mandated every man to fulfil his military duty. However, this decree extended far beyond mere obligation; it ignited a cultural obsession with martial excellence. The Rathores established a lasting legacy by embedding a profound focus on martial education within their society, cultivating a relentless drive to enhance their military capabilities with great fervour. From a young age, Rathore Rajputs were trained in the arts of war. Their education was not limited to the physical aspects of combat but also included strategy, leadership, and the warrior's code of honour. Swordsmanship, archery, and horse riding became second nature to them, as they were groomed to be formidable warriors. This rigorous training ensured that every Rathore man was prepared to defend his homeland and uphold the honour of his dynasty. The Rathores' dedication to military excellence was evident in their impressive array of forts and strongholds, strategically placed to defend their territory. These architectural marvels were both functional and symbolic, representing the strength and resilience of the Rathore clan. Their armies were renowned for their discipline, skill, and indomitable spirit, often emerging victorious against formidable adversaries. This martial culture permeated every aspect of Rathore Principality, fostering a sense of unity and purpose. Festivals and ceremonies celebrated military achievements, and tales of heroic battles and warriors were passed down through generations, inspiring future soldiers. The Rathores' relentless pursuit of military superiority ensured their place in history as one of the most formidable Rajput dynasties of their time. Now that we have fully integrated the lands of the Rathores, and our Rulers have seen their full potential, we have started to integrate these Rajputs in our own army. While we have been at odds in the past the dust of war and conflict has now settled and we have earned their respect. The military prowess of our ruler has made them see sense and they now fully submit to our king. They will serve as our most loyal and professional Rajput soldiers."
