 hee_SAX.1.t:0 "The Treaty of Leipzig"
 hee_SAX.1.d:0 "Following joint rule for two decades, the two brothers ruling the von Wettin family in 1485 divided Saxony between them. While in many ways remaining a joint duchy, the elder brother, Ernest, gained the electoral lands around Wittenberg, before dividing the duchy by \"I cut, you choose,\" where Ernest divided the lands. The younger brother, Albert, picked the lands around Meissen, while Ernest gained the recently acquired lands of Thuringia.\nWhile the Wettins remained split in two branches ever since, the Lands of Saxony would be reunited by Maurice of Saxony in 1547, following the Schmalkaldic War. \nNevertheless, decades of separation prevented Saxony from effeciently competing with the dynamic rise of its neighboring rivals, the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg."
 hee_SAX.1.a:0 "Dividing our lands is the right course for our family."
 hee_SAX.1.b:0 "One Duchy, One Dynasty!"
 hee_SAX.2.t:0 "Rivalry With the Hohenzollerns"
 hee_SAX.2.d:0 "While our centuries-old house of von Wettin has grown into one of the great powers of Central Germany, we were not invested with the Dukedom of Saxony until 1423. \nAt about the same time, in 1415, our neighbors the Hohenzollerns were granted Electoral rights by investment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. This upstart family does not know the lands of Central Germany the way we do, and cannot yet see that we are the rightful great power of the region."
 hee_SAX.2.a:0 "They will see the might of the House of von Wettin!"
 hee_SAX.2.b:0 "A diplomatic approach could benefit both our houses."
 hee_SAX.3.t:0 "The University of Wittenberg"
 hee_SAX.3.d:0 "Established in 1502 by Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony, the University of Wittenberg was a grand, but still fresh institution that had barely opened its doors before the events that would make it go down in history.\nOne of the very first professors was the theologian Martin Luther, who would go on to become the spark that fired up the Protestant Reformation, with the university of Saxony as one of the earliest centres of the Reformation.\nWith that in mind, what kind of education should we encourage at this great, new university."
 hee_SAX.3.a:0 "Thinkers here should be free to present whatever ideas they believe."
 hee_SAX.3.b:0 "Let us encourage... traditional forms of research."
 hee_SAX.4.t:0 "Religious Reformer Seeks Protection"
 hee_SAX.4.d:0 "With the rising desire for changes within the church, the pope and his imperial allies have started to consider the most notable reformer in the empire a serious threat to the eternal salvation of the populace.\nFollowing a disputation called by the emperor, the reformer has refused to recant his views on the church and the proper practice of faith. Although he was granted safe passage to the disputation, that will only last for another day before forces will be sent after him. As he works and travels in our lands, the only way to ensure his safety would be by taking him away to a secluded castle, hidden from imperial forces."
 hee_SAX.4.a:0 "We must help him continue to spread his word."
 hee_SAX.4.b:0 "$MONARCH$ would not go against both the emperor AND the pope."
 hee_SAX.5.t:0 "Lurking Crypto-calvinism"
 hee_SAX.5.d:0 "Crypto-Calvinism was the influence of Calvinism within the Lutheran Church, and was considered a serious threat to the new church following the death of Martin Luther.\nIn Saxony, Calvinist principles were fairly common among prominent figures as a result of the powerful Philippist party's secret promotion of Calvinism in the electorate. (Philippist after Philipp Melanchton, Luther's closest ally.)\nWhile Crypto-Calvinists seized power in the Saxon church during the rule of Elector Augustus, but gradually works that were undeniably Calvinist in nature came to light. In 1574 the entire leadership of the Philippist party were arrested, and their efforts were counteracted until the establishment of the Lutheran Formula of Concord - defining a \"true\" Lutheran doctrine - ended their influence completely."
 hee_SAX.5.a:0 "Seize their leaders and throw them in jail!"
 hee_SAX.5.b:0 "No, their faith doesn't prevent them from being excellent administrators."
 hee_SAX.6.t:0 "Head of the Corpus Evangelicorum"
 hee_SAX.6.d:0 "The Corpus Evangelicorum was a gathering of Protestant princes that was finally formally established following the Peace of Westphalia. \nAfter the Thirty Years' War, the Corpus Evangelicorum would not struggle with enormous religious questions the way it would have in the preceding century, but it nevertheless kept meeting over various issues until the end of the Empire in 1806. \n\nThe Elector of Saxony held the privileged position of leader of the Corpus Evangelicorum, thanks to Saxony's status as the birthplace of the reformation and as the predominant Protestant state at the time of the Corpus' formation. This tradition held so strong, that even Saxon electors who converted to Catholicism were allowed to lead the gatherings, provided the privy council was given charge of all matters religious in Saxony, and only admitted Protestants."
 hee_SAX.6.a:0 "Peace to the Empire and glory to Saxony!"
 hee_SAX.7.t:0 "Transfer Religious Responsibility to the Privy Council"
 hee_SAX.7.d:0 "In 1697 the Elector Augustus II von Wettin converted from Protestantism to Catholicism. This was largely due to his ascension to the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as the Polish king was required to be Catholic.\nAs the Dukes of Saxony were renowned as champions of the reformation, Saxony remained the leader of the Corpus Evangelicorum, the imperial board of the Protestant estates, but now with the Catholic Augustus at its head. Augustus guaranteed Saxon Protestantism however, and followed orthodox Lutheran doctrine in his dealings with other Protestant states. However, to guarantee future von Wettins for the throne of Poland meant that every possible successor had to convert to Catholicism, including the future elector Augustus III. Upon this the Estates of Saxony began protesting, threatening revolt in defense of the Protestant faith. Augustus II therefore transferred all religious control in Saxony to the Electoral privy council, as suggested by the Corpus Evangelicorum. The privy council also established that only a Protestant might partake, which meant that Protestantism in Saxony was safeguarded, and disaster averted."
 hee_SAX.7.a:0 "It is only right to acknowledge our divided interest."
 hee_SAX.7.b:0 "The [Monarch.GetTitle] rules as [Monarch.GetSheHe] sees fit!"
 hee_SAX.8.t:0 "The Frauenkirche and the Hofkirche of Dresden"
 hee_SAX.8.d:0 "Dresden Frauenkirche was torn down in 1727, and a Protestant church was built in the Baroque style between 1726 and 1743. The tall, bell-shaped dome would come to define any view of Dresden for the following two centuries.\n\nHowever, the Catholic elector Augustus III felt that Dresden needed religious balance, and therefore in 1738 initiated the construction of the Katholische Hofkirche (which would later become Dresden Cathedral). The Hofkirche was completed in 1751, and meant that Dresden had not just one, but two enormous Baroque churches."
 hee_SAX.8.a:0 "Dresden has church building fever!"
 hee_SAX.8.b:0 "Let's put the money towards other civic projects."
 hee_SAX.9.t:0 "Maria Josepha of Austria"
 hee_SAX.9.d:0 "Maria Josepha was the wife of Frederick Augustus II, and thereby Electress of Saxony and Queen consort of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1734 to 1757. While she lived in Saxony, she often accompanied her husband to Poland, even several times after he became embroiled in the War of the Polish Succession. She learnt to speak Polish, and was often present for assemblies of the Polish parliament.\nAs a strong political figure, she practically governed Saxony during Frederick Augustus' absence, though she was never officially named regent. She was a dedicated Catholic, even being chided by her confessor for being more religious than behooved a person outside a monastic order. Nevertheless she preached tolerance, and gave alms as much to poor Protestants as poor Catholics.\nAs a former heiress presumtive of the imperial throne, she became an active player in the War of the Austrian Succession, before ceding her claim in favour of an alliance with Austria. Her politicking continued her entire life by influencing the power balance between Saxony and Poland as well as between her sons, the heirs to the thrones. During the Seven Years War, she was placed under house arrest by the Prussians, but kept on communicating with the outside world through the use of Prussian connections and letters written in invisible ink."
 hee_SAX.9.a:0 "A great queen, for Poland and Saxony both."
 hee_SAX.10.t:0 "Martin Luther Publishes Theological Treatise"
 hee_SAX.10.d:0 "Before the reformation, Martin Luther was a theological scholar at the university of Wittenberg, and his writings were academic in nature. While certainly critical of aspects of the church, they were meant as texts that searched for new answers within old doctrines, rather than presenting new doctrines of their own. It was largely through papal and imperial reaction to the Lutheran texts that they became directives of faith that sparked Luther's reformational work.\n\nNow one of these texts has been discovered before reaching wide circulation, and it does have some deeply incisive comments about papal practices. What is to be done with it?"
 hee_SAX.10.a:0 "These are some very good points, actually. Especially thesis eighty-six."
 hee_SAX.10.b:0 "Burn it. Does this lowly theologian think he knows God better than the Pope?"
 hee_SAX.11.t:0 "Nikolaus Krell"
 hee_SAX.11.d:0 "Nikolaus Krell was the chancellor of the elector of Saxony from 1589 to 1591, a position he used to further his Calvinist beliefs at the cost of Saxony's Protestant traditions. As an influential and capable politician, he ensured Calvinsits were appointed to high offices, especially in the church, and he had a translation of the bible with Calvinist annotations published and disseminated.\nIn the end, distrust of his faith and jealousy at his position and influence with the elector meant that when Elector Christian died in 1591, rivals in the nobility ensured that he was arrested. He remained imprisoned for ten years, six of them in trial at the Reichskammergericht, before being sentenced to death for Crypto-Calvinism.\nHe was decapitated in Dresden, and a paving stone with the letters \"Kr\" still marks the exact place of his death."
 hee_SAX.11.a:0 "He is too good to give up, even if he is a Calvinist."
 hee_SAX.11.b:0 "Crypto-Calvinists are trying to bring down everything Saxony stands for!"
