 FEE_Kazan_Events.1.T: "Arabic Center of Science"
 FEE_Kazan_Events.1.D: "During the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, Kazan was a center of scholarly learning. Much of its urban population was literate, and much of the knowledge of the Arabic world was stored and catalogued in its many libraries. Many of these libraries would later be lost to the tumultous history of Kazan and Russia, but for now it is knowledge that can benefit us."
