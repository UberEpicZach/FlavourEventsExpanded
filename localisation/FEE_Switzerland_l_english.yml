 FEE_Switzerland_Events.1.T: "Swiss Mercenaries Succeed Abroad"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.1.D: "In the late middle ages, Swiss mercenaries became a common sight on the battlefields of Europe. This was in no small part thanks to the fact that the Swiss cantons organised and trained regiments that could be bought into service in other parts of Europe. \nThe Swiss became known as some of the deadliest soldiers in Europe, as they were trained to work together to perform devastating mass attacks as a single unit. \n\nEventually, after two centuries of being the finest soldiers on the battlefields of Europe, Swiss mercenaries would find their match in the widespread use of firearms."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.1.OPT1: "This can only be good for Switzerland."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.1.OPT2: "Let us establish another regiment."

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.2.T: "Swiss Mercenaries in Our Army"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.2.D: "Ever since the battle of Basel in 1474, Swiss mercenaries made up the very core of French infantry troops. These soldiers, with their bravery and military tactics, were some of the finest fighters in all of Europe. Only when the traditional formations of pikes and halberds were overtaken by ubiquitous firearms would the French kings come to rely more heavily on national regiments."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.2.OPT1: "Request more troops from the Swiss!"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.3.T: "In Service of the French King"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.3.D: "The very core of the French army relies on regiments of Swiss infantry to hold the line. The French [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] has requested that we bless our cantons' participation in French wars."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.3.OPT1: "This seems the beginning of a very fruitful partnership."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.3.OPT2: "These men will fight for Switzerland, not France!"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.4.T: "Switzerland Condemns Mercenaries"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.4.D: "How dare they?! Switzerland has claimed that Swiss soldiers should only ever fight for Swiss cantons! The regiments already fighting for us are getting paid too much to leave, of course, but this is an irreparable offense."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.4.OPT1: "If only French troops were the best in Europe instead of Swiss! Ah, a [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] can dream."

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.5.T: "Jörg Jenatsch"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.5.D: "Born in Gräbunden in 1596, Jörg Jenatsch was a protestant theologian and politician while the Thirty Year's War ravaged the rest of the Holy Roman Empire. \nHe was involved in the political struggle around the Valtellina region between France and Venice on one side and the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs on the other, where he led the anti-Spanish faction. \nA violent life led him to lose his position in the church, but he excelled as a soldier, and eventually came to command his own regiment. He went on trial for murder an insubordination, but only sat in prison in Venice while serving there. \n\nIn 1635 Jenatsch was assassinated by a man costumed as a bear, an unfortunate end probably brought on by the several murders he had committed in his struggles."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.5.OPT1: "He should advise us in the art of war."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.5.OPT2: "Let us send him into the field."

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.6.T: "Bündner Wirren"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.6.D: "The Bündner Wirren, or Confusion of the Leagues, was a chaotic period in the history of Switzerland lasting from 1618 to 1639, where France and Venice contested with the Habsburgs of Spain and Austria to control the Valtelline area in Gräubunden. \nThe valley was one of the most important passes between Austria and Italy, and whoever controlled it could largely dictate how much Austria would be able to reinforce the Habsburg armies there. Gradually the strategic conflict became one of religion, and the entirety of Gräubunden got involved on one side or the other. \nThe valley changed allegiance multiple times, before settling in the hands of the leagues of Gräubunden in exchange for a guarantee of free exercise of the catholic faith."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.6.OPT1: "The valley must oppose Catholic influence."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.6.OPT2: "We would not dare oppose the Habsburgs."

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.7.T: "Johann Rudolf Wettstein"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.7.D: "The Mayor of Basel and a lifelong public servant, Johann Rudolf Wettstein participated in the negotiations for the Peace of Westphalia, despite not having been invited, and despite the Confederacy's initial refusal to accredit him. He quickly proved himself as a diplomat, however, and through long, grueling negotiations managed to secure official recognition of Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.7.OPT1: "He will serve our country well as a diplomat."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.7.OPT2: "He will certainly do well for us in foreign courts."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.7.OPT3: "He will do the most good here at home."

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.8.T: "The Bernoulli Family"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.8.D: "The Bernoullis were an entire family of mathematicians, a scientific dynasty spanning a hundred years from the late 17th century. While originally from Germany, the family settled in Switzerland to escape religious persecution. \nThey were behind multiple discoveries within a range of mathematical fields, from probability to calculus. They also made important discoveries in physics, including Bernoulli's Principle, the principle that would later be used to develop the carburetor and the airplane wing. \n\nAcross three generations, the family gave rise to no less than eight prominent mathematicians."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.8.OPT1: "With thinkers like these, we will lead the enlightenment of peoples."

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.9.T: "Peace in the Zurich War"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.9.D: "Land disputes and separatist tendencies of the canton of Zurich caused a full-out war between Zurich and the rest of the Swiss Confederacy in 1436. Despite the intervention first of the Habsburgs and then of the Dauphin of France, by November 1444 the Swiss had stood firm!\nIn the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs in August 1444, the Swiss forces, utilizing innovative pike square tactics, inflicted such heavy losses on the invading French mercenary army that the French withdrew from the war completely.\nDespite these victories against non-Swiss opponents, Zurich itself has withstood our forces. Now, however, both sides are tired of the war. Zurich now wishes to re-enter the Confederacy if its territorial claims are recognized, but its previous alliance with the Habsburgs remains a cause of concern…."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.9.OPT1: "Give the Zurichers what they want, but they must annul their treaties with the Austrians!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.9.OPT2: "Focus on resolving the land dispute in a way both sides can accept"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.9.OPT3: "How dare they make demands of us? Let them go crawling to the Habsburgs if they want!"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.10.T: "The Swabian Wars"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.10.D: "The 15th century saw great wealth come into the Swiss cantons as their mercenaries became famous throughout Europe. This wealth brought about expansionism on the part of the Swiss, as this was well before the age when neutrality was thought of as a good thing.\nPerceiving the rising Confederacy as a threat to their own interests, many south German states began banding together against the common threat of Swiss and Bavarian expansion. Eventually, even the ever-meddlesome Habsburgs intervened against the Swiss.\nBeing almost unbeatable on the battlefield and resentful of constant imperial interference, the Swiss would set their sights on securing greater autonomy, and eventually even independence, from the Empire."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.10.OPT1: "The Swiss Confederacy must expand if it is to survive!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.10.OPT2: "We must pursue independence from these oppressive emperors!"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.11.T: "The Burgundian Wars"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.11.D: "Territorial disputes between the expansionist Duke of Burgundy and the Austrian emperors once again create a situation where the Swiss Confederacy is caught in the middle and is forced to fight. The arrogant Duke may think he can triumph against us, but the Swiss are stronger than anyone reckoned!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.11.OPT1: "Onwards, men!"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.12.T: "Charles the Bold takes command against the Swiss"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.12.D: "The Swiss have proved an able opponent, with a small though well-disciplined and well-led force. Our Duke has made what may be a fateful decision: raise a new army, this time with himself at its head!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.12.OPT1: "I have a good feeling about this…"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.12.OPT2: "On second thought, perhaps this isn't wise."

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.14.T: "The Duke of Burgundy Killed!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.14.D: "The unfortunate decision to lead the Burgundian army has cost The Duke of Burgundy his life. Failing to heed warning of enemy reinforcements, he soon found himself both surrounded and outnumbered by the Swiss and their allies.\nAs the Burgundian army began to dissolve in wild panic, The Duke of Burgundy stayed in the center, trying in vain to rally his men. He is said to have said “I struggle against a spider who is everywhere at once” on seeing how the Swiss outnumbered his forces.\nWith only him and his personal guard holding firm, he was hacked to pieces by Swiss halberds."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.14.OPT1: "What will we do now?"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.15.T: "The Duke of Burgundy Killed!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.15.D: "The unfortunate decision to lead the Burgundian army has cost The Duke of Burgundy his life. Failing to heed warning of enemy reinforcements, he soon found himself both surrounded and outnumbered by the Swiss and their allies.\nAs the Burgundian army began to dissolve in wild panic, The Duke of Burgundy stayed in the center, trying in vain to rally his men. He is said to have said “I struggle against a spider who is everywhere at once” on seeing how the Swiss outnumbered his forces.\nWith only him and his personal guard holding firm, he was hacked to pieces by Swiss halberds."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.15.OPT1: "A glorious Victory!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.16.T: "The Reformation Enters Switzerland"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.16.D: "As the Germans to our North become embroiled with the teachings of Luther, new voices are starting to crop up here in Switzerland.\nOne new preacher, named Ulrich Zwingli in a rural canton has begun to question the Catholic Church's practices, but refuses any comparison to Luther.\nIn a nation which respects democratic principles and fiercely guards its independence from kings, emperors, and even popes, it is unquestionable that we allow one of our own to continue voicing his opinions even in defiance of outsiders. What remains to be decided, however, is how much we listen to what he has to say."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.16.OPT1: "For a peasant, he seems to have a lot to say. Let us take him in!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.16.OPT2: "How interesting. He can stay in the fields, though…"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.17.T: "The Sausage Affair"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.17.D: "Although Zwingli's preaching career got off to a rocky start, especially with early sermons against the excesses of Swiss mercenaries, he quickly grew wildly popular in the countryside for his passionate reforming message. Soon, the town council at Zurich awarded Zwingli with the position of “People's Preacher” in their town and in the canton more broadly, at the age of only thirty-five!\nHis career in Zurich started off fast and furious. He and his followers decided that only an ostentatious display against Catholic “superstitions” and “legalism” could effectively introduce the Reformation to Switzerland. To that end, on the first day of Lent, a time when Catholics were meant to abstain from eating pork and other “rich meats,” a large crowd of Zwingli's followers held a feast of pork sausages – right in the middle of the town!\n Soon, more and more Zurichers were violating the Lenten rules. Authorities arrested Zwingli, but he argues that, since the Lent laws are unbiblical, neither he nor anyone else may be punished for breaking them."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.17.OPT1: "He has a point! Release him!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.17.OPT2: "The law is the law! Throw him in prison!"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.18.T: "The Disputation"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.18.D: "After the infamous Sausage Affair, Zwingli only escalated his attacks on the Catholic church; now, he refers to the Pope in Rome as a non-biblical church leader and declares our Bishop's authority to be null and void. He even has declared that the Mass is unbiblical!\nWhile this is outright heresy, we in Switzerland have always handled differences of opinion in stride. In typical democratic fashion, the government of Zurich has decided to hold a public debate between Zwingli and leading Catholic theologians of Switzerland. Their rule that the Bible alone would be used as the basis was already a victory for Zwingli before the debate started.\nNonetheless, the Catholic theologians implored the citizens not to break with centuries of tradition, while Zwingli argues that his opinions are from the Bible and nothing else. In the end, it was a close debate, with public opinion wavering between the two sides. Now, we must decide who the winner was."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.18.OPT1: "Zwingli has proven himself and his beliefs!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.18.OPT2: "The Catholic Church has proven itself worthy!"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.18.OPT3: "What in the world are you all talking about we aren't filthy papist or calvinists"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.18.OPT4: "It is too close to call! Let the people vote and decide!"

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.19.T: "Zwingli's triumph"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.19.D: "Zwingli has shown that the papacy is non-biblical and that the bible is the true word of god. The dust has settled and the teachings of John Calvin will now reign supreme in Switzerland."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.19.OPT1: "Imagine being a filthy papist."

 FEE_Switzerland_Events.20.T: "The Church's triumph"
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.20.D: "The church has shown that the papacy is holy and just, and that while the bible is the true word of god, our culture and unity as christians is equally important. The dust has settled and the teachings of The Church will now reign supreme in Switzerland."
 FEE_Switzerland_Events.20.OPT1: "Imagine being a filthy calvinist."
