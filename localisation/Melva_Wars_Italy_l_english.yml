 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.100.T: "Guerra del Gesso"
 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.100.D: "The little more than twenty year old King of France [FRA.Monarch.GetName], through his paternal grandmother, Maria of Anjou (1404-1463), claimed a distant hereditary right to the crown of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1492 he directed the resources of his kingdom towards the conquest of that realm, encouraged by Ludovico Sforza, called Il Moro (who was not yet Duke of Milan but was only its regent) and urged by his advisors, Guillaume Briçonnet and de Vers. \nThe reconquest of the largest kingdom of the Peninsula, already ruled by the House of Anjou (from 1282 to 1442), did not include, in the projects of Charles, Sicily. Through the conquest of the kingdom of Naples the king of France could have not simply increased the dominions of his House, an ambition common to many Middle-European or Anglo-Saxon ruling houses, but rather to make them the starting point for those Crusades whose echo had been reinvigorated by the expulsion of the Arabs from the last Spanish possession, the Kingdom of Granada (1492). The political project of Res Publica Christiana Pro Recuperanda Terra Sancta still had a hold in the European aristocracies, despite the fact that the eight Crusades aimed at realizing it ended in disaster. The King of France himself, Louis IX, lost his life during the Eighth Crusade. Acre, the last Christian stronghold, fell definitively in 1291."

 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.101.D: "And now the War has been brought over the prosperous lands of Italy and hell will unleash on the flourishing Peninsula that saw peace for 50 years thanks to the efforts of Cosimo de Medici and the Venetian Republic. \nThe King of France has declared his Restoration of Union on the Kingdom of Naples and we must decide, who will we side with, France or Naples?"

 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.101.OPT2: "Naples must not be subjugated!"

 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.200.T: "Cavalry"
 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.200.D: "Heavy cavalry - the latest evolution of medieval armored knights - remained the protagonist in the battlefields of the Italian wars. The French gendarmes generally proved to be the most effective against the horse troops of the other states, mainly because of the excellent horses in their possession. The Spaniards used a type of cavalry called Jinete in their sorties."

 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.400.T: "Artillery"
 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.400.D: "The Italian wars saw artillery, especially field artillery, take on an indispensable role in any first-rate army. Charles VIII, during his invasion of Italy, brought with him a truly mobile siege procession, consisting of culverins and bombards mounted on wheeled trolleys, which could be deployed against an enemy fortress immediately upon arrival. The French siege arsenal brought with it several technological innovations. Charles's army used horses to pull cannons rather than the oxen typically used up to that time. Furthermore, French cannons, forged in the same methods used to produce bronze bells, boasted a previously unknown lightness and mobility. The most important improvement of the French however was the creation of iron cannonballs. Before the Italian wars, artillery fired stone balls that often shattered upon impact. The invention of water mills allowed the operation of furnaces with a temperature sufficient to melt the iron in order to make cannon balls. With this technology, Charles's army could conquer, within a few hours, walls and castles that had previously resisted sieges for months or even years. \n\nThe armies of the Italian wars were led by a great variety of commanders, from mercenaries to noble leaders up to the king himself."
 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.400.OPT1: "Tear them down!"

 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.500.T: "Forts"
 Melva_Wars_Italy_Events.500.D: "Most of the fighting that took place during the Italian wars took place during the sieges. That of the first descent of Charles VIII in Italy is traditionally considered the initial date of the development of the fortification to the modern, which will lead to the birth of increasingly complex fortified systems during the subsequent invasions. The army of Charles VIII in fact had a modern artillery in front of which many antiquated medieval castles had to succumb. These systems will soon spread throughout Europe, initially by Italian engineers."
