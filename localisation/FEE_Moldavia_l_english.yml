 FEE_Moldavia_Events.1.T: "Athleta Christi"
 FEE_Moldavia_Events.1.D: "Since the 15th century, \"Athleta Christi,\" or Champion of Christ, was a title granted by the pope to men who had defended Christianity by leading campaigns against the enemies of the faith. \nStephen III of Moldavia was granted the title in 1475, after a defeat of the Ottomans that was decisive enough for the Pope to proclaim him \"Verus Christianae Fidei Athleta,\" True Champion of the Christian Faith."
 FEE_Moldavia_Events.1.OPT1: "Glory to Moldavia!"

 FEE_Moldavia_Events.2.T: "Mount Athos"
 FEE_Moldavia_Events.2.D: "Mount Athos was the home to 20 Orthodox monasteries in Ottoman-occupied Greece. They were under the direct authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople, and tried to keep good terms with the sultan after the right to their land had been confirmed by Murad II in 1453. However, by the late 15th century, the monasteries had ended up in debt to the Sultan, and they now stood to lose the land they were built on. \nStephen III, however, drew from his personal coffers to pay off their loan, so that the Greek monasteries would not be lost."
 FEE_Moldavia_Events.2.OPT1: "Glory to God!"
 FEE_Moldavia_Events.2.OPT2: "We cannot afford that."

 FEE_Moldavia_Events.3.T: "Vasile Lupu"
 FEE_Moldavia_Events.3.D: "Born in 1595 and known as \"The Wolf\" (Lupu), Vasile was a capable administrator and a great schemer who came to the throne of Moldavia through a series of complicated intrigues. Once in power he turned out to be a brilliant financer, and became one of the richest men in Eastern Europe. His wealth sustained gifts to the Ottoman sultan, which placated Moldavia's overlord and kept the country in good standing. \nVasile Lupu was a builder and a patron of the arts, but at the cost of unbearable taxation on the peasantry. Eventually he would come into conflict with the prince of Wallachia, who after long wars replace him with one of his own nobles. Lupu died in a prison in Constantinople in 1661, eight years after being deposed."
 FEE_Moldavia_Events.3.OPT1: "We want gold! Give us Lupu!"
 FEE_Moldavia_Events.3.OPT2: "We need the stability of a Wallachian prince."
