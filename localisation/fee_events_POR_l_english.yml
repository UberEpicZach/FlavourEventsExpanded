 fee_POR.3.tt: "Spiceless!"
 fee_POR.3.dd: "With the final fall of Constantinople to the Turks came not only the end of Christian control of the Bosporus but also the expulsion of many Italian merchants hailing from a diverse and competitive array of Italian states; the only ones allowed to stay being the conniving Venetians. Ever mindful of profit over faith, those opportunistic snakes have cozied up with the Turks, abandoning all principle for their precious ducats.\n\nThe overland routes to India and the spice trade are all but cut, the lifeline that supplied us with exotic goods and spices. The Venetian monopoly may make them rich, but ultimately we are left spiceless and desperate for it, as is the rest of Europe. This situation is unacceptable!"
 fee_POR.3.a: "Well I guess we'll have to find another way to India!"

 fee_POR.4.dd: "Nestled in the Southwest corner of Europe sandwiched between Spain and the Atlantic Ocean, the Portuguese people have always been natural seafarers. Lately, however, a prince in our court by the name of Dom Henrique de Viseu has put forth the idea that Portugal must secure a place on the seas in order to sail farther down the coast than any previous Europeans.\nDrawing on Portuguese tactics, cutting-edge Venetian advancements, and newly-discovered science, Henrique has proposed an unprecedented leap in royal patronage of navies. An organized school which not only teaches the sailors and admirals of tomorrow, but researches improved methods of cartography, ship design, and maritime combat. Additionally, he tells us that the royal patronage of the navy to an extent hitherto unseen in Europe will give Portugal the advantage she desperately needs in this age of discovery."
