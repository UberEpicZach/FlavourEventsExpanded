 FEE_Burgundy_Events.2.T: "A Burgundian Feast?"
 FEE_Burgundy_Events.2.D: "The great wealth of the Burgundians had become legendary in Western Europe by the mid-15th century. So great was it, some said, that an average Burgundian knight was wealthier that the King of France! One of the expressions of this wealth were the enormous and extravagant feasts hosted by the Dukes. Rich wines, exotic meats, spectacular troubadour and jongleur performances, fancy desserts, and beautiful wares all enchanted guests from all over Christendom, and this in turn made Burgundian luxury items in more demand. Burgundian styles became the most prominent in Europe in the 15th century, even surpassing the dazzling Venetians. With enough saint feast days to cover all the year round, shall we host another feast to remind our friends and enemies alike of our greatness?"

 FEE_Burgundy_Events.2.OPT2: "We can wait..."

 FEE_Burgundy_Events.4.D: "Born in Aalst in 1415, Georges Chastellain began his career as a soldier in Burgundian service but soon became a diplomat in the service of King Charles VII of France, attempting to broker peace between France and Burgundy. When relations soured, he joined Phillip of Burgundy's council and continued to work as a diplomat. However, when he fell to ill health, he was given a pension and was requested to write a chronicle of recent events. As a writer, he quickly became known for his mastery of poetry, rhetoric, and historiography. His Chronique became one of the best sources for Burgundian-French relations during the 15th century, and he is considered a key contributor to the development of the French language."
