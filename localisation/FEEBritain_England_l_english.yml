    fee_gbr_eng_d_1: "Educated first as a lawyer and then as a statesman, Sir Francis Bacon quickly rose to prominence due to a brilliant intellect and a passionate devotion for understanding and uncovering the truth in all areas.\n\nHis greatest work, the Novum Organum, was a breakthrough in the scientific understanding of the world, where Bacon laid a foundation for empiricism and outline for the first time the steps of the Scientific Method."

    fee_gbr_eng_n_2: "The Authorized Version"
    fee_gbr_eng_d_2: "As the Reformation and printing press sweep mainland Europe in tandem, here in England the Bible has been no stranger to the English tongue. Indeed, as far back as 1382 the Bible was translated into English by John Wycliffe. In more recent times, translations from the continent have started to arrive, and the first printed English Bible was produced by William Tyndale in 1525.\n\nHowever, the Wycliffe Bible is outdated and thus difficult to read; the continental translations are too full of notes (some of which run contrary to our own beliefs!) to be useful, and Tyndale’s Bible is incomplete.\n\nTo this end, $MONARCH$ has summoned a conference at a royal palace in Hampton Court, including scholars, theologians from every protestant sect in England, and even playwrights and printers. Of this motley crew, who shall be primarily entrusted with the Word of God?"
    fee_gbr_eng_1_2: "Only the theologians can be trusted in this matter."
    fee_gbr_eng_2_2: "Surely the eminent scholars of our land are best suited for this task."
    fee_gbr_eng_3_2: "Would not God himself wish his Word be translated with beauty?"
    fee_gbr_eng_4_2: "On second thought, perhaps ths whole thing isn't worth it."

    fee_gbr_eng_n_3: "The Wicked Bible"
    fee_gbr_eng_d_3: "The royal project to translate the Bible into English was an astounding success. Not only is it a uniform translation, but one done with such literary excellence that many scholars consider it stylistically superior to the Greek original!\n\nWhile the finished product may be magnificent, that did not, however, prevent several errors on the part of the printers. One particularly embarrassing error, quickly dubbed the Wicked Bible to riotous laughter among the populace, omitted the word “not” from one of the Ten Commandments. The result? “Thou shalt commit adultery.” Of course this defect was quickly corrected, but what shall be done with such a miscreant printer?"
    fee_gbr_eng_1_3: "Fine him, revoke his license, and confiscate his business!"
    fee_gbr_eng_2_3: "This was embarrassing, but still a simple mistake."
    
    fee_gbr_eng_n_4: "The Acts of Union"
    fee_gbr_eng_d_4: "With the subjugation of Scotland all but completed and with the reigning in of Ireland well underway, the Acts of Union seek to formalize this unification de jure by claiming the mantle of the ancient Roman name of Britannia. However, while England is by far the largest and most powerful of the three British crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland, a lasting union cannot be maintained simply with England alone while ignoring the others. As the Romans did before us, the Celtic fringe of Britannia is simply too proud and tumultuous to be ignored, and perhaps unable to be controlled by military means alone.\n\nTo the end of preserving a stable union, the Acts of Union have been proposed, creating a co-equal union rather than a purely English-dominated empire, in which Scottish and Irish concerns would both be heard. Doing this would keep the individuals kingdom’s commotions from destabilizing the land as a whole."
    fee_gbr_eng_1_4: "We must have a complete and co-equal union!"
    fee_gbr_eng_2_4: "The Scots must be included, but the Irish will always be our subjects."

    fee_gbr_eng_d_5: "Despite the de jure unification of the crowns of Britain, several more rambunctious elements, especially the Highland clans, still manage their own affairs with little regard for what the crown has to say. Our Scottish officials have managed to bring them willy-nilly to the table to settle their differences with us at Icolmkill but perhaps continuing this decentralized pattern would be beneficial for us in the long term?"
    fee_gbr_eng_1_5: "Ours shall be an Indirect Empire."

    fee_gbr_eng_n_6: "Samuel Pepys"
    fee_gbr_eng_d_6: "Despite having no maritime experience, Samuel Pepys was a skillful navigator in the political sense, using his position as a member of Parliament to secure a place in the Admiralty. There, he proved surprisingly adept at his various duties, overseeing an early professionalization of navies in Britain. Additionally, the careful diaries he kept would not only prove a useful historical source but also provide a role model for British captains in their record-keeping."
    fee_gbr_eng_1_6: "An excellent minister!"
    
    fee_gbr_eng_n_7: "The Puritans"
    fee_gbr_eng_d_7: "Despite the relative religious peace enjoyed by our island, in marked contrast to the religious strife on the continent, not everyone here is satisfied with our religious state of affairs. A number of more radical sects have found a receptive audience.\n\nThe most prominent of these are a sect of radical reformers who have come to be called Puritans due to their belief that our church is impure and must be radically purged and purified to be acceptable to God. Their biggest grievances with us include our toleration of Catholics and other heretics, as well as what they view as materialism and hedonism within the church.\n\nTheir influence is magnified by the fact that many of their followers come from within the emerging middle and merchant classes."
    fee_gbr_eng_1_7: "I suppose they have some valid points. Allow them to speak freely."
    fee_gbr_eng_2_7: "What a bunch of complainers! Enforce religious uniformity and silence them."

    fee_gbr_eng_d_8: "With wars and unrest always taxing on the national economy, a few ambitious and pragmatic bankers have approached us with a way out our current financial straits. Not only would this rid us of our national debt, they say, but would also stand to make not only us, but anyone who invests in their plan a healthy profit.\n\nTheir plan? Turn our debt into payable securities to be sold in exchange for stock in their new trading company, dubbed the South Seas Company, which would receive a crown monopoly on all trade in the “South Seas.” What exactly the South Seas are was never really defined anywhere, but the agents of the Company assure us that our share of Company stock would make us more money than we could dream of needing to pay off our debt.\n\nIt all seems rather confusing, and nothing has been specified or promised on paper. Our bankers strongly advise against this, but it could yet solve our problems."
    fee_gbr_eng_1_8: "By all means, do... whatever it is they said we should do, and hope it pays off!"
    fee_gbr_eng_1_8_tooltip: "We will see what the company brings back from the South Seas."

    fee_gbr_eng_n_9: "South Sea Bubble Bursts"
    fee_gbr_eng_d_9: "We should have known it was too good to be true!\n\nWith their wild promises, royal backing, but no real assets to secure their scheme, people from the richest circles to the poorest alleys flocked to put everything they had into the South Sea Company. The soaring stock prices caused a ripple effect causing rents, food, and even human hair to become astronomically expensive as everyone anticipated a quick and easy payout. That is, until some of the most prominent shareholders realized what was going on and pulled out. The resulting crash wiped out the fortunes of thousands overnight and high prices for everything that few could afford. Many have even been driven to suicide.\n\nThese scheming scoundrels have single-handedly crashed the national economy!"

    fee_gbr_eng_d_11: "Relations have never been good between the [fee_gbr_eng_ear_target.GetAdjective] and ourselves in our competition for New World and African trade. Now, however, has come yet another increase in tensions due to the barbarous conduct of the [fee_gbr_eng_ear_target.GetAdjective]!\n\nIt seems that a ship of the [fee_gbr_eng_ear_target.GetAdjective] coast guard – a fine title for a glorified pirate! – stopped and boarded a British merchant vessel. Robert Jenkins, the ship’s master mariner, was accused of smuggling. Without trial or hesitation, the [fee_gbr_eng_ear_target.GetAdjective] captain simply drew his sword and cut off Jenkins’ Ear! Worse, he threatened to do the same to our monarch if he should come.\n\nThis gravest indignity weighs not only on Jenkins but on the honor of our entire nation!"

    fee_gbr_eng_d_12: "While originally from Prussia, George Frederic Handel was a Baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London. Often considered one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, and indeed of Western Civilization generally, Handel was known for his choral compositions, sinfonias including “Arrival of the Queen of Sheba,” and coronation anthems for the British crown.\n\nHis greatest achievement, “The Messiah,” was an opera showcasing the Christmas and Easter stories, whose chorus so impressed $MONARCH$ that it caused [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to rise from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] seat in respect, an honor that no British monarch had ever given a composer."
