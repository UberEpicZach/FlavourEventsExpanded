 FEE_Gujarat_Events.1.T: "The Northern Frontier"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.1.D: "The ever-growing power of the North has become a graver concern with each passing year. Their military prowess is undeniable, and their very name instils fear within our ranks and among our nobility. They have faced far stronger powers than us and have even stood toe-to-toe with the Delhi Sultanate when it was still a worthy adversary, not the decaying shadow it is today. Each day, Mewar's influence expands, and with it, the threat to our existence becomes more palpable. Our nobles are pressing us to take action against them, but it is clear that we have lost control of the situation. Our past mistakes and prolonged idleness have finally caught up to us, leaving us in a precarious and vulnerable position. The urgency to respond has never been greater, yet our options grow fewer as Mewar's power continues to rise."
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.1.OPT1: "We need to act."

 FEE_Gujarat_Events.2.T: "Subdue the Rajputs"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.2.D: "The Rajputs within our realm have gone too far, exercising rights they claim were bestowed upon them by false Hindu gods. As a devout Muslim realm, we cannot allow them to besmirch or control the government with the laws of their so-called gods, which directly contradict the laws of Allah and the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is time to put an end to their power. We will confiscate their palaces and dismantle their power structure. While we acknowledge that the Rajputs are deeply entrenched in our society, we must act decisively and show strength. These heathens cannot be allowed to dictate how the Sultan rules his realm. Our actions must make it clear that the true authority lies with the Sultan and that the laws of Allah will prevail over any other."
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.2.OPT1: "Deal with the Rajputs."
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.2.OPT2: "Let them be."

 FEE_Gujarat_Events.3.T: "Revenge of the Rajputs"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.3.D: "It seems we may have overreacted; our harsh punishment of the Rajputs has come back to haunt us. Their influence among the Hindu population was far more entrenched than we anticipated. Now, they are being wielded as a weapon against our rule. Their demands are severe: they seek the head of our Sultan and the entire Diwan. There is one more demand, my liege, they insist that one of their sons be named heir to the crown. We face a dire choice. We can either give in to their demands, which would mean the death of the court as we know it, or we can stand firm, fight for what we believe in, and uphold our decisions. Which path shall we take? Do we bow to their demands and sacrifice our sovereignty, or do we prepare to defend our realm, even at the risk of greater conflict?"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.3.OPT1: "Fight! Fight like hell!"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.3.OPT2: "I concede."

 FEE_Gujarat_Events.4.T: "Shahr-i-Mu'azzam"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.4.D: "Shahr-i-Mu'azzam or Ahmedabad is a bustling hub, a testament to the architectural and cultural prowess of the Sultanate of Gujarat. The city thrived under the rule of the sultans, who transformed it into a centre of trade, art, and scholarship. It was during the reign of Sultan Mahmud Begada, one of Gujarat's most illustrious rulers, that the city truly flourished. \n\nSultan Mahmud Begada, known for his military campaigns and patronage of the arts, sought to make Shahr-i-Mu'azzam a beacon of prosperity. Under his watchful eye, grand mosques, palaces, and public works sprouted, their intricate designs reflecting the Islamic architectural marvels of the time. The city became a magnet for scholars, poets, and traders from far and wide, fostering an environment where knowledge and commerce thrived hand in hand. The Sultanate of Gujarat, with Shahr-i-Mu'azzam at its heart, stood as a formidable force in Western India. Its strategic location along the coast facilitated trade with distant lands, bringing in wealth and diverse influences that enriched the cultural fabric of the city. Markets buzzed with activity, showcasing goods from across the seas, while the local artisans honed their crafts, creating works that were admired far and wide. However, the fortunes of Shahr-i-Mu'azzam, like many cities of old, waxed and waned with the tides of history. The arrival of European powers, particularly the Portuguese, marked the beginning of a new era. The fierce battles and shifting alliances disrupted the Sultanate's dominance, leading to periods of decline and resurgence."
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.4.OPT1: "The Great City indeed."

 FEE_Gujarat_Events.5.T: "The Battle of Diu and its Aftermath"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.5.D: "In the early 16th century, the azure waters off the coast of Diu bore witness to a dramatic and pivotal conflict that would shape the fate of empires, the Battle of Diu. The year was 1509, and the Portuguese, eager to dominate the lucrative spice trade routes of the Indian Ocean, faced fierce resistance from the combined forces of the Sultanate of Gujarat, the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt, the Zamorin of Calicut, and the Republic of Venice who had supplies a decent number of ships to the Mamluks. This formidable alliance sought to challenge Portuguese incursions and preserve their own maritime interests. The stage was set for a grand naval confrontation. The allied fleet, commanded by the Mamluk admiral Amir Husain Al-Kurdi, sailed with a formidable armada, brimming with warships and determined warriors. Opposing them was the Portuguese fleet under the leadership of the formidable commander Francisco de Almeida, the Viceroy of Portuguese India, who sought vengeance for the death of his son at the hands of the Mamluks. As the sun rose over the horizon on February 3, 1509, the two fleets clashed in the waters near Diu. The battle raged fiercely, with cannons roaring and swords clashing. The allied forces fought valiantly, their ships manoeuvring with precision and skill. Yet, the Portuguese, with their superior firepower and advanced naval tactics, began to gain the upper hand. In the chaos of battle, the Portuguese unleashed devastating broadsides, tearing through the enemy vessels. The air was thick with smoke and the cries of warriors, as ships splintered and sank beneath the waves. Despite their bravery and resolve, the allied forces found themselves overwhelmed by the relentless Portuguese assault. By the end of the day, the waters were littered with the wreckage of ships and the bodies of fallen sailors. The Portuguese emerged victorious, their dominance of the Indian Ocean secured. The Battle of Diu marked a turning point, solidifying Portuguese control over the spice trade and heralding a new era of European colonialism in Asia. The aftermath of the battle saw the decline of the Sultanate of Gujarat's naval power and the weakening of the Mamluk Sultanate's influence in the region. For the Portuguese, it was a triumph that would pave the way for their maritime empire, shaping the course of history for centuries to come."
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.5.OPT1: "I concede."
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.5.OPT2: "We will fight them on the high seas and on land, never surrender!"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.5.tt: "§OWe will offer [POR.GetName] the following terms. The effects will only apply, if [POR.GetName] accepts:§!"

 FEE_Gujarat_Events.6.T: "Report on the battle of Diu"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.6.D: "Against all odds, our intrepid explorers won a great victory on the high seas over the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName]. Our fleets were outnumbered 10 to 1, and yet our fearless sailors, our naval weaponry ingenuity, and the boldness of our captains, to say nothing of divine favor, have granted us total victory. The great Muhammadan alliance arrayed against us in India is no more, with their ships either sunk or fleeing to harbor to lick their wounds. This was the first battle to introduce the tactic of naval broadside, which was used by our admiral to devastating effect against the more numerous Gujarati fleet. [Root.GetName] has entered the Indian Ocean as a force to be reckoned with, and it is only a matter of time before its fleet is master of the monsoon seas. \n\nHumiliated, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has approached us with [From.Monarch.GerHerHis] terms, what would lay the precedent for many "unequal treaties" to come. To us would go the city of Diu itself, the sight of our victory, as a treaty port for us to have unlimited access to the trade of the Gujaratis. Their monopoly on western Indian trade would be broken. Do we accept these terms?"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.6.OPT1: "We accept the terms!"
 FEE_Gujarat_Events.6.OPT2: "They are weak now, let us push for more..."
