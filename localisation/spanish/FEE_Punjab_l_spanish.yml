 FEE_Punjab_Events.1.T: "Path to Jivanmukta"
 FEE_Punjab_Events.1.D: "The moment of destiny has dawned for Punjab, as the sacred duty to reclaim our rightful lands beckons. Lahore, Sirhind, and Sind Sagar - these lands, hallowed by our ancestors and steeped in the essence of our heritage-have languished too long under the rule of those without true claim. Though the journey ahead may be fraught with challenges, we are resolute in our belief that our struggle will not be in vain. The flame of righteousness burns within us, guiding our swords and spirits towards the liberation of our beloved homeland."

 FEE_Punjab_Events.2.T: "The Sikh Confederacy"
 FEE_Punjab_Events.2.D: "The Kingdom of Punjab, the sacred heart of India, stands united under the banner of Sikhism. Our faith has transformed our confederacy into a powerful and unified kingdom, a beacon of hope and strength. Yet, our brethren continue to suffer under the oppressive rule of the Mughals - those Muslim tyrants who have dared to hang our revered Gurus, desecrate our leaders, and threaten the sanctity of our holy scriptures. This injustice cannot stand. Inspired by the martyrdom of Guru Arjan, we are called to action. Our swords will sing, and our rifles will thunder, as we embark on a righteous crusade to liberate our people and avenge the wrongs committed against our faith. The greatness of Punjab will echo through eternity, as we march to show the world the strength and resolve of our people."
 FEE_Punjab_Events.2.OPT1: "Mobilize the full force of the kingdom"

 FEE_Punjab_Events.3.T: "Khaalasaa Raaj"
 FEE_Punjab_Events.3.D: "Thus, the time has come. In the years since the unification of the Sikh Confederacy, the Kingdom of Punjab has ascended as the sacred heart of India, a beacon of unity under the banner of Sikhism. Our faith, once the force that forged a powerful and unified kingdom, now calls upon us to reach even greater heights. The mantle of Empire awaits, and with it, the destiny to lead all of India under the righteous light of the Khalsa. The world shall witness the rise of a new era, where Punjab stands as the unyielding pillar of justice and strength."
 FEE_Punjab_Events.3.OPT1: "Raj Karega Khalsa"

 FEE_Punjab_Events.4.T: "Eternal Army"
 FEE_Punjab_Events.4.D: "As the Kingdom of Punjab, the sacred legacy of Sikhism rests upon your shoulders, a burden as holy as it is heavy. The echoes of our Gurus' teachings call us to greatness, yet the shadow of mighty empires looms near, and the legacy of Muslim firearms has left our forces trailing in their wake. But this is not a time for despair; it is a time for renewal. We must forge a new path, reforming our army into an Immortal Brigade - a force that embodies the timeless spirit of our faith, capable of enduring the trials of time and ensuring that the light of Punjab never dims. This is our divine duty, and by the grace of Waheguru, we shall fulfil it."
 FEE_Punjab_Events.4.OPT1: "Raise the Immortal Brigade"

 FEE_Punjab_Events.5.T: "Reforming the Akal Sena"
 FEE_Punjab_Events.5.D: "Many years have passed since the noble Akal Sena was first formed, their valour etched into the annals of Punjab's history. Yet, as the world turns and new challenges rise on the horizon, the time has come for a transformation. The enemies we now face require a different approach, one that combines the ancient art of hand-to-hand combat with the cunning of guerrilla warfare and the ferocity of shock tactics. This new era demands an army that reflects the purity of our cause - an army of the Pure, forged in the fires of righteousness and prepared to face whatever trials the future may bring."
 FEE_Punjab_Events.5.OPT1: "An Army of the Pure"

 FEE_Punjab_Events.6.T: "The Sikh Khalsa Army"
 FEE_Punjab_Events.6.D: "The tides of war have shifted, and the age of cavalry, once the backbone of our might, is waning as artillery and firearms dominate the battlefield. The time has come for the Kingdom of Punjab to adapt and create a modern Sikh Army, drawing upon the lessons learned from the Khalsas and neighbouring civilizations. We shall embark on a comprehensive reform, revolutionizing our training and organization, and setting new standards in logistics, troop deployment, and marksmanship. The emphasis will now be on the steady fire of disciplined infantry over the outdated reliance on cavalry and guerrilla tactics. Our artillery will be strengthened, and the standing army will be funded directly from the treasury, freeing us from dependence on local feudal levies. This reformed army will be the embodiment of our resilience and innovation, ready to face the challenges of the modern battlefield."
