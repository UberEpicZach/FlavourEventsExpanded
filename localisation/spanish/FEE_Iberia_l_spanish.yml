 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.T: "The Irmandiño Revolts"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.D: "As the Spanish kingdoms focused on the southwards reconquest of Iberia against the Moors, the traditional northern heartland regions often became neglected. \nGalicia in particular became a hotbed of instability during the latter half of the 15th century, as noble and clerical power were evenly divided in the region, and the poor weather of the Little Ice Age hit Galicia's temperate climate especially hard. As the nobles and clergy squabbled for power, the peasants, lower nobility and merchants were increasingly oppressed, including outright banditry from the nobles and extortion from the priests. \nNow, the Galicians can stand it no longer. At first gathering in secret, the Irmandiños (brotherhood) have now armed the people, who have now risen up in revolt against their oppressors! Targeting the nobility in particular, they have already destroyed dozens of castles, and the nobility have now come to both us and the king of Portugal, desperate for our aid."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.OPT1: "Crush them! Ensure that this never happens again!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.OPT2: "Attempt to negotiate the conflict."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.1.OPT3: "The Irmandiños have a point! Curtail these criminal nobles!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.T: "Pedro Madruga"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.D: "While not of one of the major noble families of Galicia, and even rumored to be a bastard, Pedro Madruga was a peerless example of the best of medieval knighthood in Galicia. While courteous, even-tempered, and polite, he was also a fierce warrior and became exceptionally skilled in all areas of warfare. Travelling between Castile and Portugal only facilitated his study of different and advanced battle techniques, both on land and at sea. \nDespite all this, he would never have become known were it not for the Irmandiños Revolts. He personally led the victorious royal and noble troops to victory, and was the first to introduce the early modern arquebus to northern Iberia, a factor which no doubt was vital to his victory."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.OPT1: "Invite him to our court! Only the best for the flower of our knighthood."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.OPT2: "He must lead our armies!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.2.OPT3: "We are in need of leaders for our fleet."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.T: "The Autonomous Regions"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.D: "The question of the various constituent kingdoms of our realm has always been a nagging one for the Catholic monarchs of Iberia. The very fact that many of them were recognized by Popes past as kingdoms in their own right has been a source of contention, as nobility and peasant alike have felt unrepresented in our court, causing widespread resentment. \nWith the Reconquista complete, now is the time to reorganize these outlying regions. [Root.Consort.GetName] has recently come up with the idea of a national Cortes where each region has their own representation. [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, desiring increased power in these regions, would prefer a viceroyalty. This would allow some local rule while still maintaining a dependence on the crown. However, this likely would not satisfy the regions. Most radical of all would be either withdrawing royal authority or attempting to assert total control."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.OPT1: "Establish a National Cortes!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.OPT2: "Appoint Viceroys to these regions."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.OPT3: "These people are more trouble than they are worth - let the local nobles deal with them."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.3.OPT4: "Am I not the monarch? Curtail these impudent provinces!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.T: "Fate of the Fueros"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.D: "With the Basque people finally fully integrated into our realm, the question of how best to manage their affairs remains to be settled. Being one of the oldest and most proud kingdoms of Christian Iberia, the former kingdom of Navarra stubbornly guarded its ancient institutions. \nAmong those was the Fueros, the royal charter of Navarra which not only gave Navarra kingdom rank but granted considerable autonomy to its nobles and guaranteed rights to its peasants. Now, representatives of these parties have approached us, requesting that we continue to respect these rights. In exchange, they promise their fullest support for us in other internal and external affairs."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.OPT1: "What's good for them is good for us."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.4.OPT2: "It's time for them to recognize who's really in control here."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.T: "The Institutions of Catalonia"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.D: "From it's very beginning as a march of the Carolingian Empire, Catalonia has diverged from the rest of Iberia in maintaining its unique laws and customs, some derived from Salic law, and some even from pre-Roman times. Over time, these customs were codified in the Usatges and later in the four great institutions of Catalonia. These were: the Consell de Cent, Las Corts Generals, the Consulat del Mar, and the Generalitat de Catalunya, representing the nobility, lawyers, traders, and the general estates, respectively. \nThese institutions have been maintained even under the dominion of the crown of Aragon, and now the Catalonians petition us to continue their rights as well."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.OPT1: "Preserve the Institutions."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.OPT2: "Make minimum concessions, but make it clear we mean business."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.5.OPT3: "Who do these peasants think they are? Our subjects, that's what!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.T: "The Catalonian Revolts"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.D: "As Spanish monarchs take steps to promote their rule as absolute monarchs over the whole of Iberia, one region in particular has not forgotten their ancient rights and privileges; in fact, many there still believe that those privileges are theirs by right. The Institutions of Catalonia have become a rallying standard for the preservation of rights in the face of royal absolutism. \nEven more infuriating to the Catalonians is the increasingly outward focus of the Spanish crown, with quests for the new world and domination of Europe leaving their Mediterranean-focused and trade-dependent cities behind. Now, the Catalonians are demanding their ancient rights be encoded in an inviolable Constitution, a thing heretofore unheard of in the Iberian kingdoms. \nIf we do not act quickly, this simmering resentment might boil into outright revolt. Groups of militia known as “El Segadores” have already been gathering arms and rousing the populace with fiery invectives against our \"tyranny\""
 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.OPT1: "Concede to the Constitutionalists."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.6.OPT2: "The Catalonians have interfered with the state for long enough! Crush them!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.7.T: "Catalonia Defies [From.GetAdjective] Oppressors!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.7.D: "The Catalan people of Catalonia have had enough of the rule of our hated enemies in §Y[From.GetName]§! and have broken free! Should we ally with this fledgling state to support their independence war?"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.7.OPT1: "We must show them our support!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.7.OPT2: "This is not our war."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.T: "The Great Earthquake of 1755"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.D: "[227.GetName] is in ruins! On All Saints' Day 1755, one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded struck just 200 kilometers off the coast of Portugal, rocking the nation completely. Portugal was typically earthquake-prone, [227.GetName] in particular having been severely damaged before in prior disasters. This earthquake proved to be like no other though, the death toll estimated to be about 40,000 and the great capital of Portugal destroyed, through earthquake, tsunami or fire. The earthquake itself was reported to have created crevices 5 metres wide in the city centre. Many retreated to the open spaces of the docks, to see the sea retreat to display a barren, muddy plain. Roughly an hour after the earthquake, a colossal tsunami ripped through [227.GetName] up the River Tejo, destroying all in its path. The shaking and shockwaves from the earthquake and its subsequent tsunami knocked over all varieties of candle and set the city ablaze, turning the already ruined city into a firestorm. \nBy the time the disaster was over, 85% of [227.GetName] was destroyed and countless works of art, literature, architecture and history were lost. King Joseph I and his court were, by sheer luck, out of [227.GetName] due to his daughter's wish to spend All Saints' Day away from the capital. King Joseph himself developed claustrophobia due to the tragedy, and was terrified of living within walls for the rest of his life, instead opting to move the court to a mass of tents on the outskirts of [227.GetName]. The prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal used this to gain power, leveraging the earthquake to take control of the royal court, and establish himself as the primary political figure in Portugal through his handling of the disaster."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.OPT1: "[227.GetName] shall be ruins forever more."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.OPT2: "Bury the Dead and heal the Living!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.8.OPT3: "Restore order by any means necessary!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.9.T: "Foundations of Seismology"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.9.D: "The destruction of [227.GetName] was a great tragedy, but life goes on. We learn from our mistakes and better ourselves and thus we must learn from this too. There is a great deal of material to study here. Let us create a new school of the sciences, dedicated to studying these earthquakes."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.9.OPT1: "Knowledge can always be gained from suffering. In future we may stop such great losses."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.T: "Jimenez de Cisneros"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.D: "Initially starting as a humble Franciscan friar, Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros was thrown in prison for his disagreements with the archbishop of Toledo (who is no stranger to meddling in our own affairs as well!). Upon his release, Jimenez devoted his life to reforming the church, gaining such a reputation for holiness that he became archbishop himself, as well as personal confessor of Isabella de Castilla and cardinal. \nConvoking long-overdue synods, Jimenez rooted out most, if not all, clerical corruption in Spain. Beyond this, however, he sponsored schools for the laity, oversaw the flooding of Castilian markets with translated devotional texts, and spread a new school of mystical through in clergy and laity alike. Essentially, his reforms were almost single-handedly responsible for reviving the piety of the Spanish people, purging corruption, and making Spain into the devout Catholic bastion of the early modern world, unlike any other in the world."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.OPT1: "Embrace these Reforms!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.OPT2: "Let us show moderation..."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.10.OPT3: "Reforms? Pah! Everything is fine!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.11.T: "University of Alcala"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.11.D: "The brainchild of Jimenez de Cisneros, a new university at Alcala was opened to produce the best educated clergy in the world, and became known especially for its studies of Biblical languages and skill at translating them. In addition, it harmonized Renaissance humanist ideas with solid Catholic dogma in a way no other clerical school did. During the Reformation years, it would grow to become a powerhouse of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, sending trained priests to hold back reformers in Ireland, France, and Italy as well as producing many missionaries for Spain's overseas territories."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.11.OPT1: "We will provide whatever this school needs!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.11.OPT2: "The church should be helping our treasury, not the other way around!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.T: "On the Donation of Constantine"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.D: "Since at least the 8th century, the Catholic Popes have made repeated reference to the \"Donation of Constantine\" said to be an imperial decree of the ancient Emperor Constantine himself, giving the Pope political authority over Western Rome as well as spiritual power. \nIndeed, it is this very claim to authority under the doctrine of Translatio Imperii that provides legitimacy for the Holy Roman Empire itself! \nThe legitimacy of the Donation has been questioned since the 11th century for various reasons. Now, however, a philological scholar in our own court has completed a years-long analysis of what is said to be the source document for this sweeping claim to power. By pointing out linguistic inconsistencies, he makes a convincing proof that the document is, in fact, a reprehensible forgery. Indeed, the scholar, named Lorenzo Valla, claims the forgery is so obvious that even the current Pope must be complicit to use it so brazenly. \nMaking this known to the world, however, given the great importance that the Donation has assumed, would make a lot of enemies, and risks undermining the church itself! At the same time, it could shore up our own claims in Italy… \nPredictably, the Inquisition has demanded we turn Valla over to be tried for heresy. How shall we proceed?"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.OPT1: "Even the Pope cannot partake in lies!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.OPT2: "We can afford to compromise here"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.OPT3: "Hand over this charlatan to the Inquisition!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.OPT3.tt: "The holy father must remain supreme!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.12.tt: "§YEvery Catholic Country's§!: Opinion of §Y[PAP.GetName]§! changed by §R-30§! \n§Y[PAP.GetName]'s§! opinion of §YEvery Catholic Country§! changed by §R-30§!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.T: "Juan de Avila"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.D: "Building on the reforms of Jimenez de Cisneros, priest Juan de Avila became a staunch advocate for the reform of the clergy, almost forseeing the religious turmoil to come due to clergy corruption. Selling his entire inherited wealth to benefit the poor as an example, he undertook a remarkable journey as an itinerant preacher through Andalusia, ministering to the poor and railing against clergy abuses, especially the practice of nobility of setting up their children in a comfortable lifestyle as priests. Understandably them, his preaching of revival (recogimiento) led to resentment among some powerful families. \nNow, certain noble families have captured him and dragged him before the Royal Inquisition, demanding he recant and be silenced."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.OPT1: "He only speaks the truth! Give him a position here to make his call nationwide!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.OPT2: "Let him go free and continue his pilgrimage."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.13.OPT3: "He is guilty of heresy for questioning the church!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.T: "Reforming the Benedictine Order"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.D: "The oldest of all the monastic orders, the Benedictines have thrived throughout Europe, but especially in Spain. The independence of individual monasteries historically set them apart from their competitors and fostered a more austere and purer lifestyle, but it has also introduced disunity and confusion in their ranks. \nNow, as we confront the reformation, it is imperative that we assist these holy men in reaffirming their original vows and make the Order into a worthy example for our own more official holy orders."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.OPT1: "Sponsor the Benedictines!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.14.OPT2: "They can take responsibility for themselves!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.T: "Reform among the Franciscans"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.D: "Reacting to a gradual slackening within the Franciscan Order, a group of monks in Andalusia has begun to advocate strongly for a revival of strict adherence to the Franciscan vows, travelling the countryside barefoot to prove their point. \nThese monks have found an able leader in Pedro de Alcantara. An austere mystic, rumor has it he only sleeps two hours a day. Under his rule, the discalced (barefoot) movement has started to gain massive popular support."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.OPT1: "Reform the whole Franciscan Order to be an example to the world!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.OPT2: "Let us take heed of these devout men, but don't rush things."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.15.OPT3: "These men are blind fanatics! Arrest them!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.T: "The Jesuits and the Ministry of Teaching"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.D: "The new Jesuit order founded by Ignatius de Loyola has taken both Catholics and Protestants by surprise with its new-found tenacity, zeal, and above all effectiveness. Unique among all holy orders was their vow to accept any and all missions given by the Pope in Rome. This combined with an acute awareness of the importance of Catholic education has made them the spearhead of the Counter-Reformation. Protestants have even taken to calling them the \"shock troops of the pope.\" Indeed, they have even become renowned experts of spycraft as they are trained to effortlessly blend in and evangelize even in kingdoms hostile to the Pope. \nTheir ambitious mission, to found Catholic schools all over Europe, and indeed the world, and staff those schools with the best and brightest minds in all fields, could potentially make them a potent force for us! However, as of now their ambitious outstrip their resources. Besides, with unmatched zeal and papal control and sanction comes great power, perhaps eventually too great for the Most Catholic Monarch of Spain to handle."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.OPT1: "Let us generously fund Jesuit Expansion!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.16.OPT2: "Let us ensure the Jesuits know their place."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.T: "Luis de Molina"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.D: "As Protestant, Reformed, and Catholic compete in Europe in an increasingly entangled and confusing Reformation, various debates concerning the freedom of the will and its seeming opposition to the power of God have filtered from the debates between reformers into the Catholic church as well. \nOne Spanish priest, Luis de Molina, has undertaken to resolve this issue and ensure that out Holy Church does not get torn apart yet again by the spirit of the Reformation. His treatise On the Harmony of the Free Will with the Gift of Grace, Divine Foreknowledge, Providence, Predestination, and Reprobation became the foundation for so-called \"Molinism,\" which though never officially approved by the Pope, has at least received Rome's tacit approval."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.OPT1: "Embrace Molinism."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.OPT2: "Let the Holy Father decide!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.17.OPT3: "Ignore the Issue..."

 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.T: "Jesuit Plot Uncovered!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.D: "The Societas Jesu has been extremely successful in its mission of conversion, education, and subversion, exploding onto the scene of the Age of Reformation like an artillery barrage upon those who would see the Catholic church fall. Additionally, as their success has grown, so to has their independence, and even the Pope to whom they still swear obedience exercises little control over them. \nNow, murmuring rumors about a sinister side of the Jesuits seem to have been borne out: a former Jesuit has brought to light a terrifying book: allegedly a compilation of carefully laid plans to overthrow monarchies throughout Europe and even destroy the Papacy itself! \nWhile it is unclear the extent to which this is true, it is true that the Jesuits' iron grip on childhood education gives it much power, and public opinion has started to shift decidedly against them. Even the Papacy is taking steps to condemn and possibly dismantle the Order."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.OPT1: "Ignore these vile rumors!"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.18.OPT2: "It's time we curtail the power of the Order!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.T: "The Poor Laws"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.D: "Despite the many differences between the various branches of the Reformation, one thing all sides agree on is how disgraceful it is for any society to have large numbers of neglected poor, forced to beg to survive. \nMany Protestant and Reformed realms have already sought to reform charity as the traditional church charity structure loses its standing and resources, seeking to put extensive governmentfunded measures in place instead. The time has come for us to make a decision on whether to follow them or not."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.OPT1: "Pass the Poor Laws."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.19.OPT2: "Do Not!"

 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.T: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo"
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.D: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernizing the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government. \nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.OPT1: "His work in Naples makes the Crown proud."
 FEE_Iberia_Events.20.OPT2: "His talent should be used in other parts of our empire."
