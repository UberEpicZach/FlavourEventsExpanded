 FEE_Habsan_Events.1.T: "The Janjira State"
 FEE_Habsan_Events.1.D: "In the year 1489, an expedition sets out to capture the formidable Murud-Janjira fortress. The Ahmadnagar Sultanate, determined to seize the castle from its ruler, Ram Patil, entrusted the mission to their Admiral, Piram Khan, a man of Ethiopian descent renowned for his cunning and bravery. Piram Khan quickly realised that the castle's formidable fortifications made a direct assault impossible. He devised a clever plan instead. Disguising himself and his men as merchants, Piram Khan approached Ram Patil with an unusual request. He asked the ruler to safeguard three hundred large boxes supposedly filled with silks and wines from Surat. Ram Patil, seeing no harm, agreed to help the seemingly benign traders. In a gesture of gratitude, Piram Khan invited Ram Patil and his soldiers to a lavish party. The event was filled with sumptuous food and copious amounts of wine. As the night wore on and Ram Patil's men became increasingly intoxicated, Piram Khan seized his moment. He revealed the true contents of the boxes, not silks and wines, but his own soldiers. They sprang out, ready for action. Taking advantage of the chaos and the drunken state of Ram Patil and his men, Piram Khan's forces swiftly overpowered them. The cunning ruse worked perfectly, allowing Piram Khan to capture the well-defended castle and the island on which it stood. The Siddi or Ethiopian General was entrusted with the stewardship of the fort and allowed supreme control and autonomy over it as long as his band of sailors fought the good fight against the non muslims in the western indian ocean. He was thus given an option to in effect erect a pirate state or well any state for that matter on his now personally held sea fort of Murud-Janjira. In the years that followed, the rulers of Murud-Janjira placed themselves under the protection of the Sultanate of Bijapur. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this strategic stronghold withstood numerous attacks from the formidable Maratha Empire, maintaining its independence and securing its place in history as an impregnable fortress."
