 FEE_Irish_Events.1.T: "Yorkists seek Irish support"
 FEE_Irish_Events.1.D: "As the War of the Roses rages on, Richard York himself, the Yorkist contender for the English throne, arrived in Ulaidh to seek the support of the Irish earls. He had previously been assigned as \"Lieutenant of Ireland,\" a largely meaningless title designed to keep him away from England. However, his time here has lent him sympathy among many of the clans, as well as contacts to turn that sympathy into military force. \nIn exchange for our recognition of him as the rightful King of England, he promises great favor to Ireland should be prevail against the Lancastrians."
 FEE_Irish_Events.1.OPT1: "An excellent opportunity! Our full support is behind the Yorkists!"
 FEE_Irish_Events.1.OPT2: "Who does this Englishman think he is? Support Richard’s enemies!"
 FEE_Irish_Events.1.OPT3: "English conflicts are not our affair."

 FEE_Irish_Events.2.T: "Yorkists Grateful for Our Aid"
 FEE_Irish_Events.2.D: "Due to his long stay in Ireland, Richard was unusually appreciative of Irish aid in gaining his current place on the throne of England. Because of this, plans have been set in motion for our benefit! A new era of peace, trade, and development may be upon us."
 FEE_Irish_Events.2.OPT1: "Our allegiance has paid off!"

 FEE_Irish_Events.3.T: "English Angered by Irish Meddling"
 FEE_Irish_Events.3.D: "Despite our support, Richard of York ultimately failed to make good on his claim to the English throne. While doubtless the ruling house of England would probably have ignored our help if we had indeed offered it, our aid to their enemies has brought us their unwanted attention. We must rush to prepare our defenses in case they launch a retaliatory invasion!"
 FEE_Irish_Events.3.OPT1: "Let them come!"

 FEE_Irish_Events.4.T: "Foreign Diplomats Arrive at Court"
 FEE_Irish_Events.4.D: "War with England is all but inevitable, as their expansion into our sacred homeland runs up against our own quest to unite the Irish people. Knowing this, diplomats from the European mainland have arrived in rapid succession, all of whom represent realms with strategic interest in keeping England in check. \nEach of them demands something in return, however. We must consider carefully which great power we become indebted to, and whether the aid they so eagerly promise against England is worth it."
 FEE_Irish_Events.4.OPT1: "Seek the support of the Dutch"
 FEE_Irish_Events.4.OPT2: "Seek a Spanish Alliance"
 FEE_Irish_Events.4.OPT3: "Only French protection can ensure our safety"
 FEE_Irish_Events.4.OPT4: "We do not need any of their help!"
