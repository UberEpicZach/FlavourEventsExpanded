Will you throw your support behind Mallikarjuna, the rightful heir by blood, or opt for a more traditional succession method, one that may better align with the expectations of the court and the people?"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.20.OPT1: "Support Mallikarjuna's Claim."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.20.OPT2: "Pursue a Natural Succession."

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.21.T: "The Gajapatis' Threat."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.21.D: "The looming presence of the formidable Gajapati Kingdom casts a shadow over our bordering provinces, exerting influence and instilling a sense of unease among neighboring rulers. As descendants of the great kingdom, we possess a unique advantage in navigating this delicate geopolitical landscape. With our heritage affording us a position of prominence among the feudatories, we stand poised to chart a course that will shape the destiny of our realm."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.21.OPT1: "To war!"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.21.OPT2: "Defence is the best offence, my lord."

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.22.T: "The Sultanate of Bahmanis."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.22.D: "Following the passing of Deva Raja II, the Southern Central regions of our realm have faced an escalating encroachment by the Sultanate of Bahmanis. Their advances, particularly in the Raichur Doab, now bring them uncomfortably close to our capital of Ampi, posing a significant threat to our sovereignty. The relentless expansion of these Persian-influenced forces from the north has left our borders vulnerable and our defences strained."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.22.OPT1: "They are advancing, Vijayanagar is near..."

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.23.T: "Vitthala Temple"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.23.D: "The Vitthala temple and market complex lies over 3 kilometers to the northeast of the revered Virupaksha temple, near the banks of the sacred Tungabhadra River. This artistically sophisticated Hindu temple in Hampi forms an integral part of the sacred center of Vijayanagara. Dedicated to Vitthala, a form of Krishna also known as Vithoba, the temple faces east and is designed with a square plan featuring an imposing entrance gopuram flanked by two side gopurams. At the heart of a paved courtyard stands the main temple, surrounded by several subsidiary shrines, all oriented to the east. Encompassing a courtyard measuring 500 by 300 feet, the temple is encircled by a triple row of pillars, standing at an average height of 25 feet. The temple is divided into three distinct compartments: a garbhagriha, an ardhamandapa, and a mahamandapa. \nA prominent feature of the Vitthala temple is the Garuda shrine, crafted in the form of a stone chariot situated within the courtyard; this chariot has become an iconic symbol of Hampi. Atop the chariot rises a tower, and in front of it stands a large, open-pillared axial sabha mandapa, or community hall. This mandapa comprises four sections, two of which align with the temple sanctum. The hall boasts 56 intricately carved stone beams of varying diameters, shapes, lengths, and surface finishes that produce musical sounds when struck; local tradition holds that this hall was used for public celebrations of music and dance. It is classified as a Karakkoil, a temple styled after the temple chariots paraded during festivals. \nThe mandapa connects to an enclosed pradakshina patha, designed for circumambulation around the sanctum. Surrounding this axial mandapa are the Garuda shrine, the Kalyana mandapa, the 100-columned mandapa, the Amman shrine, and the Utsav mandapa. The walled enclosure spans about 1.3 hectares, with colonnaded verandahs lining the compound walls. In the southeast corner, one finds a kitchen with a roof window. \nBeyond the temple compound, to its east-southeast, lies a colonnaded market street nearly one kilometer long, now in ruins. To the north is another market and a south-facing shrine adorned with reliefs depicting scenes from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the lives of Vaishnava saints. The northern street culminates in a temple dedicated to the Hindu philosopher Ramanuja. The area around the Vitthala temple, known as Vitthalapura, was a vibrant center for Vaishnavite worship, housing a Vaishnava matha that served as a pilgrimage site centered around the Alvar tradition. Inscriptions reveal that it was also a hub for craft production."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.23.OPT1: "Glory to Krishna"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.23.OPT2: "More Gold needed"

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.24.T: "Balakrishna Temple"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.24.D: "The Krishna temple, also known as the Balakrishna temple, lies on the other side of Hemakuta Hill, about 1 kos to the south of the revered Virupaksha temple. According to inscriptions, it is part of the Hampi complex known as Krishnapura. Before the temple stretches a long market street, locally referred to as the bazaar. This colonnaded stone marketplace features a broad road, allowing chariots to transport goods to and from the market, and also serves as a venue for ceremonial functions and festive celebrations. In the midst of the market to the north of this road lies a large Pushkarani, a public utility stepped water tank with an artistic pavilion at its center. Adjacent to the tank is a mandapa for people to sit and gather. \nThe temple opens to the east and boasts a gateway adorned with reliefs depicting all ten avatars of Vishnu, starting with Matsya at the bottom. Within the temple complex lie the ruins of the main Krishna temple and smaller, ruined shrines dedicated to goddesses. The temple compound is structured with multiple mandapas, including an outer and an inner enclosure, and features two gopuram entrances. Inside, a 25-bay open mandapa leads to a 9-bay enclosed mandapa. The western gopuram is decorated with friezes depicting battle formations and soldiers. \nTo the south of the Krishna temple's exterior stand two adjacent shrines, one housing the largest monolithic Shiva Linga and the other enshrining the largest monolithic Yoga-Narasimha avatar of Vishnu in Hampi. The 3-meter Shiva Linga stands in water within a cubical chamber and is marked with three eyes on its top. Further south is the shrine for the 6.7-meter high Narasimha-the man-lion avatar of Vishnu-seated in a yoga position."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.24.OPT1: "Glory to Krishna"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.24.OPT2: "Not enough gold my lord."

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.25.T: "Achyutaraya Temple"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.25.D: "The Achyutaraya temple, also known as the Tiruvengalanatha temple, lies about 1 kos to the east of the revered Virupaksha temple, near the sacred Tungabhadra River. It is one of the four largest complexes in Hampi. Notably, the temple faces north, a unique orientation, and is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The temple is approached from the river, passing first a ceremonial tank and then along a broad market street. The temple complex features an outer gopuram that leads into a courtyard with a 100-column hall, and an inner gopuram that provides entry to the Vishnu temple. Each pillar in the 100-column hall is adorned with reliefs depicting Vishnu's avatars, other deities such as Shiva, Surya, and Durga, scenes of daily life including rishis, amorous couples, jesters, people performing yoga asanas, people in namaste poses, and Vijayanagara emblems. \nThe temple gateway prominently displays the emblems of the Vijayanagara dynasty: a boar symbolizing Varaha, a sword, the sun, and the moon."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.25.OPT1: "Glory to Vishnu!"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.25.OPT2: "Gold stocks are too low"

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.101.T: "The Deccan Rekindled"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.101.D: "From the embers of fallen kingdoms, a fire has risen once more. The banners of Vijayanagar flutter high, kissed by the winds of destiny, as the land of the Deccan stands united under one undivided throne. No longer do foreign banners darken our skies, no longer do the echoes of invaders' war drums shake the foundations of our sacred soil. The temples stand tall, untouched and unbowed, the rivers sing with renewed purpose, and the earth yields its bounty to the sons of the land. The sun of Vijayanagar now blazes over the plateau, and in its golden radiance, the age of division is cast away like a shadow before dawn. Let the poets etch this day into stone, for the Deccan, once broken, now stands whole again."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.101.OPT1: "The Deccan Throne is Ours"

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.102.T: "The Throne of the Gods"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.102.D: "The city breathes with divinity. Within its walls, stone blossoms into poetry, and temples rise like the peaks of Mount Meru. Here, the king does not merely rule he embodies order, weaving the strands of caste, faith, and power into an unbreakable tapestry. He is the warrior who shields dharma from ruin, the giver whose wealth nourishes the land, the patron whose court is a theater of dance, music, and splendor. When he sits upon his throne, the gods themselves incline their heads, for he is their chosen sentinel on earth. \nTo deny him is to unravel the fabric of the world itself. To strengthen Vijayanagara is to affirm cosmic harmony, ensuring that the empire shall shine, immutable and eternal, beneath the watchful eyes of heaven."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.102.OPT1: "Seat of the Divine King"

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.103.T: "Threads of Destiny"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.103.D: "From the looms of our artisans to the courts of kings, silk has long been the fabric of power and prestige. Once the garb of monarchs and warriors alone, it now drapes the shoulders of merchants, military chiefs, and craftsmen, a testament to the wealth that pulses through our empire. Yet as our demand for silk grows, so too does the question of its source. \nThe Deccan winds carry with them a new fashion, tunics of flowing silk, embroidered caps of fine thread, a mark of the influence of the Sultanates and the Arab traders who walk our markets. Their silks are rich, their craftsmanship undeniable, their styles a reflection of the changing world. To embrace this path is to weave ourselves into the fabric of a broader, interconnected trade, binding our empire to the tastes of the West. \nYet beyond the eastern horizon lies another road, where the looms of Cathay hum with an unmatched splendor. The silk of China, long sought after by merchants and kings alike, arrives in our ports, cheap, abundant, and untouched by foreign customs. If we choose this path, our coffers will swell, our weavers will refine their craft, and Vijayanagar will drape itself in the brilliance of the Far East. \nThe choice is upon us. Shall we walk the road of the Deccan, adopting the silk and style of the western kingdoms? Or shall we turn to the silken riches of the East and make them our own?"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.103.OPT1: "Let the Deccan winds shape our attire."
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.103.OPT2: "We shall drape ourselves in the silk of Cathay."
