Although Commonwealth crown cannot control their actions directly, they are still responsible for this.\n\nWe could threaten their king with war if they won't tame these annoying vermins. Yet there is a chance that they won't back off, and in that case we would have to talk reason into them with fire and sword."

They've also reported about atrocities that rebels had committed against Polish nobility and Catholic clergy in Mahilyow.\n\nAt the same time, we have received a peace offer from Nalyvaiko in which he requires us to cede some of the lands in exchange for their military service and loyalty to the Commonwealth. Now, we have a choice how to end this. Either we accept peace offer and bring an end to this quickly. Or we can drown Ruthenian lands in blood once again."
