 hee_HUN.9.d:0 "Fekete Sereg was the military force established by Matthias Corvinus, and was active between 1458-1494. The revolutionary approach that made The Black Army such a formidable fighting force, in addition to early adaptation of gunpowder weapons, was the fact that it's soldiers were well-paid, full-time mercenaries, purely devoted to warfare. Whereas most mercenaries would return to their farm or workshop between wars, the men of the Black Army kept practicing the art of war. \n\nUnder Matthias, the army conquered large parts of Austria, and more than half of Bohemia."

At its height, there were more than 3,000 codices, called \"Corvinae\" in honor of the king, which covered every subject matter from philosophy to architecture. It's content was thought to be second only to the Vatican Library in Rome, and cemented Corvinus as a man of learning as well as a warrior. \nThe library was destroyed during the Ottoman invasions in 1526, and most of the works were lost."
