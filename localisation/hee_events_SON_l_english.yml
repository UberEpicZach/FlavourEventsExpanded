 fee_SON.1.t: "General Muhammad Ture"
 fee_SON.1.d: "In the late 15th century, a Songhai general rose to great prominence in the wars against Mali, Timbuktu and Djenné. The name of this son of the King's sister was Muhammad Ture, although posterity would know him as Askia the Great."
 fee_SON.1.a: "We couldn't hope for a better general. You'd almost wish he was king..."
 fee_SON.2.t: "The Heretic Heir"
 fee_SON.2.d: "Upon the death of Sonni Ali in 1492, his heir, Sonni Baru, refused to declare himself a Muslim.\nUpon hearing this, his cousin, General Muhammad Ture, took up arms against him. After a short civil war Muhammad seized victory and - despite a lineage that made him ineligible for the throne - declared himself king.\n\nHe was soon known as Askia (\"the Forceful\"), and by allying himself with the scholarly elite of Timbuktu he secured his power. By inviting philosophers and scholars from across the Muslim world, he ushered in a cultural and political golden era for Songhai, which had risen to the status of an empire less than a generation before."
 fee_SON.2.a: "Only a true Muslim may hold the throne!"
 fee_SON.2.b: "We will support the true heir!"
