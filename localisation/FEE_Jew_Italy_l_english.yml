 FEE_Jew_Italy_Events.1.T: "The Jews of Italy"
 FEE_Jew_Italy_Events.1.D: "The presence of Jews in Sicily is attested by archaeological finds starting from the third century BC. Rabbi Akiva visited the city of Syracuse during one of his trips abroad. In the first centuries after Christ: at the end of the sixth century this presence was confirmed by some letters from Pope Gregory the Great. But in 1310 the King of Sicily Frederick III adopted a restrictive policy towards the Jews, who were forced to mark their clothes and their shops with the "red wheel". He also forbade them any relationship with Christians."

 FEE_Jew_Italy_Events.2.T: "Sinagoga of Savoca"
 FEE_Jew_Italy_Events.2.D: "In 1470 there is news of a restrictive measure against the Jews residing in Savoca, concerning the synagogue of that city. Since said building of worship was located in a neighborhood inhabited by Christians, moreover close to churches (Church of San Michele) and to the "Palazzo della Curia" within which the city administration and magistrates were located, in August 1470, it was confiscated by order of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The viceroy himself ordered that the synagogue be built in another place. The reason for this provision is to be found in the fact that the Savocese Jews, in officiating their rites, sang hymns in such a loud voice as to disturb the civil, judicial and liturgical activities of the Christians that took place a few steps from there. The confiscated synagogue was sold to a local Christian citizen, a certain Fulippu Sturiali who had to pay his fellow Jews a sum equal to ¼ of the value of the property and "deliver or sell" a land or a building on which said Jews could have built or transfer their synagogue. Having done this, the new buyer transformed the church building into a residential home."

 FEE_Jew_Italy_Events.3.T: "Giudecca of [Root.GetName]"
 FEE_Jew_Italy_Events.3.D: "Each Jewish community in Sicily was called aliama or judaica (Judaica) or giudecca. These communities, in the late Middle Ages, enjoyed their own political, administrative, judicial and patrimonial autonomy; they provided for the imposition and collection of taxes, and performed basic services (such as school, notary, hospital, cemetery, slaughterhouse and assistance to the most needy). Each Jewish woman had a deliberative body represented by the regional council, which in turn elected the proti (which formed the executive body) and the tax committee (which divided the burden of donations to be paid to the treasury among the families). Other roles were exercised by the shochet (slaughterhouse attendant), the mohel (the one who performed the circumcision) and the shammashim (who took care of the synagogue)."
