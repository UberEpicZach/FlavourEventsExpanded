 FEE_Ansbach_Events.1.T: "The Ambition of Achilles"
 FEE_Ansbach_Events.1.D: "While the Duchy of Franconia has long fallen into disuse, our family still holds significant lands in the area. The Margraviates of Ansbach and Bayreuth have long since enjoyed independence, away from our crown's influence. In order to secure our vested interests in the area and protect its people from foreign invasions, we should secure and press our legitimate claims on the surrounding areas by any means necessary, starting with the city of Nuremberg. Such an act will certainly be viewed as hostile and therefore we should be vigilant when it comes to approaching this delicate matter."
