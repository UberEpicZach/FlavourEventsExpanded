 south_sea_company.1.title: "An Intruiging Proposal"
 south_sea_company.1.desc: "By 1710, the British government was in deep financial distress. Constant wars, a parliament too divided to pass new taxes, and poor credit meant that it had little money, soldiers to feed, and no options to increase revenue. Worse still, the state had built up a colossal amount of debt. To avoid financial disaster, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Robert Harley, had to get creative. He enlisted his friend John Blunt, a director of the Hollow Sword Blade Company, to raise funds by any means possible. Blunt’s first scheme was to secretly buy up near-worthless army debentures – promissory notes given to soldiers when the army couldn’t afford to pay them - and then announce that anyone holding such debt could trade it in for shares in Blunt’s company. This sounded like a fantastic deal to anyone holding debentures: while the army was rather bad at repaying the debentures, shares in Blunt’s profitable company would actually be worth something. As a result, the price of army debentures skyrocketed, and Blunt turned around and sold off the debentures he purchased earlier for a massive profit. While this was certainly illegal, it provided the government with the cash it so desperately needed – encouraging them to turn a blind eye to Blunt’s questionable tactics. "

 south_sea_company.2.title: "A Better Lottery"
 south_sea_company.2.desc: "After witnessing John Blunt’s financial genius with the army debentures scheme, Harley put him in charge of the Bank of England’s lottery, hoping he could work his magic there as well. And Blunt delivered: within four days the lottery was completely sold out, bringing in much-needed revenue for the state. But here again, Blunt’s tactics were questionable. In order to make the lottery tickets so attractive, he ensured that each one would pay back at least 10% of their original price. But there was a catch: buyers wouldn’t receive their winnings immediately. Instead, they would be paid back over a period of years, meaning that the state could cash in on the ticket prices now, and pay out the prize money later. While this effectively meant more debt for the government, they still welcomed the short term cash, and permitted Blunt to hold a second lottery with even more expensive tickets. Together, the two lotteries brought in nearly one million pounds of revenue for the beleaguered government."

 south_sea_company.3.title: "The South Sea Company"
 south_sea_company.3.desc: "While Blunt’s schemes had allowed the government to cover its short-term expenses, there was still the issue of the national debt, which the government still had no plan for paying off. Harley and Blunt came up with a solution: they would create a corporation that would buy the government’s debt from its current lenders, and have the government make interest payments to their company instead. To get the government to help them with this, they would charge them a cheaper interest rate on the debt the company assumed than private lenders would. The company would then issue shares of equal value as the debt it was taking from the government, and shareholders would profit by receiving a portion of the government's interest payments. To sweeten the deal, Harley and Blunt convinced the government to give the company a monopoly on trade in South and Central America, thus coining it the South Sea Company. There was just one problem: all the major ports in the South Sea were controlled by Spain, who Great Britain was currently at war with. To fix this little obstacle, Harley and Blunt began an extensive campaign to build public support for peace with Spain."

With profits flowing in from its monopoly on trade from the lucrative plantations of our South American colonies, The South Sea Company can not only deliver amazing returns to its shareholders, but also afford to take on more and more government debt, making for cheaper loans for the government. Truly, the Company is a great boon to the entire nation."

 south_sea_company.5.desc: "War is bad for business, and it’s even worse when your business relies on trading with the enemy. As our war with Spain drags on, it has become harder and harder for the South Seas Company to convince would-be investors that their venture could ever be profitable. At long last, it seems that John Blunt’s patience has run out, as he has abandoned his post on the South Seas Company, presumably off to swindle some other poor souls."

 south_sea_company.6.title: "A Bad Deal"
 south_sea_company.6.desc: "While Harley and Blunt succeeded in persuading Parliament to end its war with Spain, quitting the fight before their allies did left them with little bargaining power when it came to negotiating the peace. The Spanish, who had no inclination whatsoever of giving up their own monopoly on trade from South America, offered the British with a mere shadow of what they asked for: they would be given rights to sell slaves from Africa in Spanish ports in South America, but they would only be allowed to send one ship to each port per year. In practice, the deal was even worse for the British, as the Spanish colonial authorities routinely ignored the agreement and refused British ships access to their ports. Any chance the South Sea Company had at making money from trade in the South Atlantic was gone."

 south_sea_company.7.title: "A Royal Institution"
 south_sea_company.7.desc: "Despite its troubles making money from its namesake trade, the South Sea Company still had good standing in Parliament and the court of the King, with many politicians and nobles holding significant shares in the company. George I of Hanover was one such noble, and when he became King in 1715, his son, George II, was elected to the ceremonial post of Governor of the company. Shortly thereafter, a falling-out between the King and his son lead to George I taking his son’s place as governor. With the King himself now on the board, the legitimacy of the monarchy became directly tied to the success of the South Sea Company – making it too big to fail."

 south_sea_company.8.title: "The Jacobite Rebellion is Crushed"
 south_sea_company.8.desc: "In February of 1719, Parliament agreed to grant the South Sea Company ownership of all the debt it had incurred in the 1710 lottery. The Company’s share price would be made equal to the amount of debt it took on, setting the share price at 100 pounds. Later that year, a Jacobite rebellion attempted to place The Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, on the English throne. When the rebellion was defeated, John Blunt did everything in his power to inflate the sense of public jubilation sweeping the country, even going so far as to print false news stories claiming the Pretender had been captured. This renewed faith in the monarchy caused the market price of shares in the South Sea Company to rise above the real value of the debt they represented, from 100 pounds each to 114 pounds each. This meant that the company could begin selling their shares for a profit, a possibility that gave John Blunt some very interesting ideas…"

 south_sea_company.9.title: "Bribing MPs"
 south_sea_company.9.desc: "By 1719, the South Sea Company was managing over a fifth of the government’s total debt, and was using the money it gained from the government’s interest payments to purchase yet more debt from private holders and the Bank of England. However, it had taken a good deal of backroom dealing to convince members of parliament to put so much confidence in the company, and John Blunt and his cohorts had given out countless bribes to keep parliament on their side. By January of 1719, Blunt had come up with an even better way to influence the government: he began issuing shares in the South Sea Company to members of parliament without demanding payment up front. Instead, he allowed the buyers to delay their payment until they sold the stock back to the company at a later date, at which point the company would pay them whatever the stock was worth at that point in time. Because the members of parliament would only have to pay back the amount the stock was worth when they bought it, if the price of South Sea stock went up in the meantime they could make a profit. This gave the MPs who bought into the deal every incentive to see the price of South Sea Company shares rise as high as possible. Seeing people of such high standing buying in to the scheme encouraged yet more officials to go for it, compounding the effect."

 south_sea_company.10.title: "Pay Shares Back in Installments"
 south_sea_company.10.desc: "By this point, the main way for the South Sea Company and its shareholders to make profits on their investments was for the share price to keep rising, so they could sell their shares for a higher price than they bought them for. To keep the demand for shares high, Blunt proposed allowing for people to pay for their shares in installments, rather than putting down the whole price up front. This meant that people could buy more shares than they could afford, thus increasing the number of shares that were bought overall, and driving the price up even further. Better still, every time the share price rose, those who had bought in just months earlier could now sell them for a profit, and reinvest that money in yet more shares. This feedback loop pumped the share price higher and higher, generating profits with every jump."

 south_sea_company.11.title: "Offer Loans to Buy Stock"
 south_sea_company.11.desc: "To inflate the price of shares in the South Sea Company even further, Blunt had the company begin lending people money to buy their shares. While this was very close to simply paying people to buy their product, it had the desired effect of increasing the market penetration of their stocks, boosting its price."

 south_sea_company.11.b: "Wait, how does that make sense?"
 
 south_sea_company.12.title: "Stock Market Frenzy"
 south_sea_company.12.desc: "The incredible success of the South Seas Company inspired other enterprises to get into the business of selling stock to raise capital. While some of these businesses were using the raised capital to produce products and make real profits, many others were less legitimate, riding on the knowledge that the mere promise of a product could be as valuable as the real thing. In either case, these new enterprises posed a problem for the South Sea Company and its investors: anyone investing in another venture was someone not investing in the South Sea Company, and therefore not helping push its share price up. To solve this problem, Blunt convinced Parliament to ban businesses from raising capital through the sale of stock, while naturally insuring that they look over the South Sea Company’s own business. While this move succeeded in funneling investment into the company, it also effectively ruined many legitimate enterprises that otherwise would have contributed to Britain’s economy. "

 south_sea_company.13.title: "Trouble on the Horizon"
 south_sea_company.13.desc: "By 1720, the South Sea Company found itself in the paradoxical position of being one of the most valuable companies in Britain without having any money in the bank. Thanks to all the bribes they paid officials, the loans they offered to help people buy their stock, and the fact that people were now only paying their shares back in installments, the company had very little in the way of cash reserves. At the same time, its exorbitant share price meant it was valued at ten times the sum of the government debt it was created to finance. And because it had given out loans to let people buy stock, and received payments in installments, it was owed more money than was in circulation in Britain’s entire economy. Nevertheless, share prices were beginning to drop, and John Blunt could not allow this. He opened up a new round of sell-offs, at an even higher price and with even better incentives. With public enthusiasm around the company still going strong, the shares all sold, and the company’s value continued to increase. Yet in the back of his mind, Blunt knew that his scheme could not go on for much longer. He and other wise investors took this last price bump as the opportunity to sell off their shares and walk away. "
 south_sea_company.13.a: "Well at least we're still making money, right?"

 south_sea_company.14.title: "The Bubble Bursts"
 south_sea_company.14.desc: "Even as he was in the process of washing his hands of the South Seas Company, Blunt made one last attempt to boost its share price. He offered a massive 30% dividend on each stock purchased, which would go up to 50% over the next ten years. Yet with the shares being at the high price they were, the thought of the Company being able to pay out a full half of that amount every year made people start to scratch their heads. Even for a company as well-known as the South Sea Company, the profits it would have to bring in to pay those huge dividends looked unrealistic. As people finally realized the South Sea Company was full of hot air, the whole scheme began to fall apart. In just three weeks, its stock price plummeted by over eighty percent, ruining anyone who had bet on the company. Bankruptcies were rampant, and even John Blunt’s own Hollow Sword Blade Company went under. The South Sea Company had finally sunk."

 south_sea_company.15.title: "The Ballad of Robert Knight"
 south_sea_company.15.desc: "With public uproar over the South Sea Company’s collapse reaching a fever pitch, parliament was scrambling to find people to blame. This was made rather complicated due to the fact that many (if not most) of the members of parliament had received bribes from the South Sea Company themselves, or else had bought shares like everyone else. Yet there was one man who everyone wanted to find: Robert Knight, the cashier of the South Sea Company. If there was anyone who would know exactly who was responsible for the crisis, it would be Knight. And indeed, Knight had been keeping a secret ledger recording every bribe the Company had given to get their way in Parliament. But as parliament debated how best to question Knight, he fled across the channel to Brussels – taking all his sensitive information with him. As politicians jockeyed to implicate their enemies in the scandal while avoiding blame themselves, Knight’s disappearance was more of a blessing than a curse: if he began to name names, the whole political edifice could come crashing down. In the end, two letters were written to the rulers of the Netherlands: one demanding Knight’s immediate return, and the other offering them a huge sum of money if he never be allowed to set foot on the island."

We are told the British crown has gotten itself into some financial trouble, with a sham trading company having convinced the gullible public to trust it with their fortunes, while bribing many high ranking officials into supporting the scheme. Of course, the scam eventually came to light, and now the company’s ruined investors are out for blood – in particular, the blood of one Robert Knight, a ringleader of the scheme who has escaped to our city of Brussels. The British are clearly having a hard time deciding how to respond to this situation, as we have received two completely contradictory requests from the Crown. The first arrived yesterday morning from an official envoy, demanding we surrender Knight to Parliament immediately so he may reveal the names of all those in government who had profited from this scheme. Yet late that night, a lone rider appeared carrying a second message. Penned by the head of Parliament himself, it offered us a massive sum of money if we make sure Knight – and his sensitive information - never finds his way back to Britain. How are we supposed to respond to such strange requests?"

Before escaping to Brussels, Knight had been quietly moving his fortunes onto the continent, meaning that despite being the most wanted man in Europe, he was living a quite indiscrete life of luxury in Brussels. This made it easy for British envoys to find him, and he was subsequently arrested and imprisoned in Antwerp. Now the game was afoot: those who wanted to question Knight would travel to Antwerp, only to find that their rivals in Parliament had arranged to have him moved to a different prison. Knight would be bounced between prisons across the city until, one dark night, his guards set him free into the woods. No one would hear of him for twenty years, and his secrets disappeared with him."

Among the names given were past and present leaders of both the Whig and Tory parties, over half of the sitting members of parliament, and even members of the Royal family itself. With the public still furious over losing their money to the company, reprisals against the accused were swift. Nearly half of the sitting members of parliament lost their seats, countless officials were purged, and dozens of nobles were disgraced. Even though he had been promised a royal pardon in return for his information, the severity of Knight’s revelations was too much for the crown to bear. The only reward Knight received for his honesty was a long stay in the Tower of London."
