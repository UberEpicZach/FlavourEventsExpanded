 norwegian_mining_act_norway_desc: "As our mining technology has improved, it has become clear to us that there are more valuables under our feet than we thought. Copper, iron and silver abounds, but we have not had the capacity to extract it, and the few mining companies that exist keep the profit for themselves. By passing a law assigning exclusive mining rights only to chartered companies, these valuable metals will at last benefit us."
