 fee_WAL.3.D: "Curta de Arges, the old capital of Wallachia, became the site of a large cathedral in the beginning of the 16th century. Finished in 1517 and restored in 1885, the building is dedicated to Saint Nicholas, and was a center of Orthodox Christianity in Wallachia throughout its existence. \n\nIt has inspired many stories and legends, one of which states that a prince designed a magnificent mosque for the Sultan that impressed the ruler of the Ottomans so that the prince was allowed to take the leftover material with him. It was from that the equally magnificent cathedral was first built."

 fee_WAL.4.T: "Changing the Seat of Power"
 fee_WAL.4.D: "Targoviste had been the capital of Wallachia for a relatively short time when, in 1659, George Ghica moved the capital to Bucharest. \nEver since the 15th century, Bucharest had been known as the strongest citadel in Wallachia, and was a favoured place of living for Wallachian princes. As the city was continually expanded and developed over the 16th century, trade and political importance in the country shifted further and further south. Soon, Bucharest was the most populous city in the princedom, and with the diminishing importance of Targoviste moving the royal court became inevitable."
