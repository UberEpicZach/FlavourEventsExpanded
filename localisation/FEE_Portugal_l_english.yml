 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.t: "Luís de Camões"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.d: "The national poet of Portugal, Luís de Camões was a 16th century lyricist, so famous for his writing that Portuguese is sometimes referred to as \"the language of Camões\"\n\nFollowing a humanist education, he spent much of his life abroad, first serving willingly in Ceuta where he lost one eye in battle, before being forced to serve in the militia in Goa to avoid prison. He kept on writing as he travelled, and did not even stop as he became cheif warrant officer in Macau. His journeys were probably what inspired his most famous work, \"Os Lusíadas,\" an epic poem in the style of Homer about the Portuguese heroes of the age of exploration. The epic was mostly written in a grotto, and one story tells how de Camões was shipwrecked and swam ashore with one arm holding the poem above the water.\n\nWhile much of his work has been lost his genius was recognised in his time, and the day of his death, June 1th, is the national day of Portugal."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.1.a: "A greater poet there never was and never will be again."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.t: "The Return of King Sebastian!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.d: "The line of Avis ended with the death of Sebastian the Child King on his crusade in Morocco, but the more than sixty years of Spanish rule that followed convinced many Portuguese that Sebastian was not truly dead, but would return one foggy day to free Portugal. This belief endured, and King Sebastian passed into legend as a sleeping hero, waiting for the day his country would need him again.\n\nOf course, a people expecting a savior and an evil oppressive state meant that there was no shortage of people trying to capitalise on the stories. There were no less than four impostors claiming to be Sebastian while Portugal was subject to Spain. \n\nNow a young man claiming to be Sebastian has arrived in Lisboa. What shall we do with him?"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.a: "His name is Sebastian, that's good enough right now."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.2.b: "Throw this impostor in the dungeons!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.T: "Spiceless!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.D: "With the final fall of Constantinople to the Turks came not only the end of Christian control of the Bosporus but also the expulsion of many Italian merchants hailing from a diverse and competitive array of Italian states; the only ones allowed to stay being the conniving Venetians. Ever mindful of profit over faith, those opportunistic snakes have cozied up with the Turks, abandoning all principle for their precious ducats.\n\nThe overland routes to India and the spice trade are all but cut, the lifeline that supplied us with exotic goods and spices. The Venetian monopoly may make them rich, but ultimately we are left spiceless and desperate for it, as is the rest of Europe. This situation is unacceptable!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.3.OPT1: "Well I guess we'll have to find another way to India!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.T: "The School of Sagres"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.D: "Nestled in the Southwest corner of Europe sandwiched between Spain and the Atlantic Ocean, the Portuguese people have always been natural seafarers. Lately, however, a prince in our court by the name of Dom Henrique de Viseu has put forth the idea that Portugal must secure a place on the seas in order to sail farther down the coast than any previous Europeans.\nDrawing on Portuguese tactics, cutting-edge Venetian advancements, and newly-discovered science, Henrique has proposed an unprecedented leap in royal patronage of navies. An organized school which not only teaches the sailors and admirals of tomorrow, but researches improved methods of cartography, ship design, and maritime combat. Additionally, he tells us that the royal patronage of the navy to an extent hitherto unseen in Europe will give Portugal the advantage she desperately needs in this age of discovery."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.OPT1: "Found Henry the Navigator's School!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.4.OPT2: "This isn't a matter for the crown."

 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.T: "A Rising Star"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.D: "During the bloody war of the Castilian Succession, one of our noblemen and soldiers proved a far more capable leader than anyone expected. Rallying our soldiers from almost  certain defeat, he turned what would have been annihilation into a victory. Now, his ambitions have grown along with his fame, and he has arrived at court seeking official promotion and new assignments abroad. "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT1: "By all means, give him what he has deserved!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT2: "That’s great, kid. Don’t get cocky."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.5.OPT3: "Such self-serving ambition is hardly worthy of our patronage!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.T: "The Shores of Africa"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.D: "Despite the inroads made by Portugal into the heart of the Moorish homeland, our control over the northern coast of Africa is being increasingly challenged by pirates and tribal raids. We have already dispatched Alfonso de Albuquerque to re-establish our control. Besides building an island fort in the area, however, he has struggled to find success. None other than Francisco de Almeida has approached us with a new and bold plan to dealing with these annoyances. A local emir has hinted that he might help us, provided we provide him with European gunpowder weaponry with which to do so. Of course, these weapons could later be used against us...  "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.OPT1: "Almeida’s plan is a good one!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.6.OPT2: "Arming our potential enemies is never wise"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.T: "Emir Lends his Aid"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.D: "True to his word, the Emir contacted by Almeida has joined us in our efforts against the Moorish pirates!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.7.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.T: "Emir’s Betrayal!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.D: "No sooner did the scoundrel Emir have our weaponry safely inside his castle than he turned them on the very ships that brought them to him! We should have known better than to trust a pirate..."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.OPT1: "We shall have his head!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.8.OPT2: "We must back down... for now"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.T: "To Africa!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.D: "Once again, Almeida has approached us with a proposal. While our ships are capable of getting to India with only minor difficulty, he says, it would be much easier for our merchants and sailors if we were to explore the eastern shores of Africa and set up supply depots for ships to stop at. Additionally, trade with the Africans themselves may prove of no small profit! Almeida even claims to have already identified three promising locations for Portuguese trading posts."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT1: "A splendid idea! Spare no expense and send out an expedition at once!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT2: "Let us not overextend; why send an armada when a few ships will do?"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.9.OPT3: "Let us steer clear of Africa. Who knows what trouble could lie there?"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.T: "Looking to India"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.D: "Having established a presence in Africa, we are tantalizingly close to India itself. Appreciative of Almeida’s success, the crown has vested him with the title “Viceroy of India.” Of course, as we yet have little presence in India this title is mostly ceremonial. Both Almeida and the crown, however, have plans to change that, both revolving around the potentially lucrative spices of Cannanore. \n\nPast that, whether their plans are the same remains to be seen. "
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.OPT1: "Let us deal diplomatically for a foothold in India, as per the crown’s plan"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.10.OPT2: "Let us listen to Almeida and use some “persuasion”"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.T: "The Zamorin"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.D: "While our setting up of trading posts in India has so far met with great success, more than one local Hindu prince is jealous of our profits. One of the most prominent, known simply as ‘The Zamorin,’ rules over the rich port of Calicut and has begun assembling an alliance against us! Rather than respecting our trade, he demands payment for all the lost trade income he blames on us having better offers than he...\n\nAlmeida wishes to meet this threat head-on at sea rather than wait for the Zamorin to come to us..."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT1: "We must prepare for battle on the seas"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT2: "Let us seek an alliance of our own to contain this threat"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.11.OPT3: "Give the Zamorin what he wants"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.T: "Almeida’s Son Killed!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.D: "After Francisco de Almeida finally settled in as Viceroy of Portugal’s holdings in India, tragedy struck. Francisco had sent his only son, Lourenco de Almeida, on routine expeditions of his own to secure additional trade opportunities on the Indian coast. However, news arrived back in Cannanore that Lourenco had run across an Egyptian fleet heading to India to pirate our hard-won trade! \n\nIn the resulting skirmish, Lourenco was killed. Francisco did not take this news well, and went into a deep depression and rage, vowing revenge. His men, having followed him for years through great hardship, are likely to follow him come what may. \n\nMeanwhile back in Lisbon, whispers at the royal court have begun to accuse Almeida of treason against the crown, that he only sought power from himself in India, where distance already makes him de-facto independent. No doubt these whispers are at least partly fueled by jealousy. Indeed, Almeida has been a loyal servant of Portugal since before the way to India was even discovered. However, the risk of treason is real, and it is not to be taken lightly."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT1: "Clearly, Almeida is no longer fit for duty."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT2: "Almeida has proven a loyal servant of the state."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.12.OPT3: "Lourenco’s death is an unacceptable loss!"

 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.T: "Almeida Defies the King"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.D: "Almeida’s thirst for revenge was clearly greater than anyone anticipated. No sooner had Alfonso de Albuquerque landed in India as Almeida’s replacement than Almeida did the unthinkable. Arresting Alfonso, he gathered a fleet and set sail on his own behalf. He promises, however, that he will return his fleet and men to the authority of Portugal as soon as his revenge is complete."
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.OPT1: "He is nothing but a traitor!"
 FEE_Portugal_Events.13.OPT2: "We have no choice but to hope he keeps his word"
