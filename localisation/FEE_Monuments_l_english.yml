 FEE_Monuments_Events.1.T: "Alhambra"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.1.D: "Built on the ruins of an abandoned Roman fort in 889 as a small fortress it was expanded on in the 10th century by Badis ibn Habus, the third Berber king of Granada (1038 - 1073). In the 13th century the Idrisid emir Muhammad I expanded and modified it. In 1333 Yusuf I, Sultan of Grenada converted the fortress into a Royal palace. After Christian forces took over the area during the Reconquista the site became the Royal Court of King Ferdinand and Isabella and was where Christopher Columbus received royal favor for his expedition with the palace being altered to fit the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I of Spain (or Charles V) built a new royal palace more befitting the Holy Roman Emperor the Mannerist style but it was never completed due to a rebellion in Grenada. Over the centuries more of the Moorish art was destroyed and in 1812 some of its towers were destroyed by the French. In 1821 the fort was further damaged by an earthquake. Restoration work began in 1829 and endowed in 1830. After his death in 1847 his son took up the work and then his grandson did after his son's death. Restoration work continued on into the 21st century. Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage site for its demonstration of late Muslim European art, some of the last without influence from the Byzantines found in Cordoba."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.2.T: "Ambras Castle"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.2.D: "References to an Amras or Omras date back to the 10th century, long before the nearby city of Innsbruck was founded. This early fort was in what was then the southwestern edge of Bavaria and the seat of power of the Counts of Andechs who would become the Margraves of Istria and then later Dukes of the short lived Imperial State of Merania from 1180 to 1248. This original fort was destroyed entirely in 1133 with no traces of it remaining although some materials from the original structure were used in the new Castle that was built. In 1248 the ruins of the castle passed into the hands of Count Albert IV of Tyrol. The modern Castle was built by Archduke Ferdinand II (1529 - 1595), the second son of Emperor Ferdinand I. When he was made the ruler of Tyrol in 1564 Ferdinand II ordered two Italian architects to turn the existing castle into a medieval fortress for his wife Philippine Weiser who he had secretly married due to her being untitled. Ferdinand prepared his family's residence in the Upper Castle while beneath it he had built one of the most artistically important halls of the late Renaissance which has been known as the "Spanish Hall" since the 19th century. In 1567 Ferdinand II entered Innsbruck as before he was the administrative governor of Bohemia and had lived in Prague since 1547. In 1589 he built another building, the Heldens Rustkammer west of the Lower Castle to house his collection of 'Heroes', the first systematic presentation of objects in the history of museums. Ambras Castle was the residence of Philippine and a place for Ferdinand II to house his weapons, armor, portraits, objects as well as various rare and precious objects. Philippine became a popular and beloved figure through her charity and willingness to help people, especially the commoners of Tyrol. After Ferdinand II died in 1595 the castle was inherited by his second son Charles of Burgau who ignored it and eventually sold it to Emperor Rudolf II in 1606 who, while living in Prague, left the Castle alone. In the ensuing years the castle was left to its own devices and seldom lived in. Lax preservation attempts ruined valuable books, manuscripts and sketches and soon the palace fell into disrepair. In the 17th century Leopold I (1640 - 1705) had some of the more valuable artifacts from Ambras moved to Vienna where they remain in the Austrian National Library. In 1805 Ambras's remaining collection was threatened by the French after their victory over the Austrians but thankfully Napoleon instead had the collection safely sent to Vienna.In 1855 Archduke Karl Ludwig, governor of Tyrol, remodeled the palace to serve as his summer residence and as such the palace underwent major changes like the building of the Outer Bailey and the park being redesigned. After Ludwig renounced his succession in 1889 however the palace once again fell into disrepair and in 1880 it was again renovated, this time as a museum. In 1919 after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary Ambras fell into the hands of the new Austrian Republic and in 1950 the Kunsthistorisches Museum took over running the castle and its collection. Through the 1970s the Spanish Hall, the Upper Castle residential quarters and the inner courtyard were extensively restored. In 1974 the Chamber of Art and Wonders was built and in 1976 the Habsburg Portrait Gallery covering the 15th to 19th centuries was finished."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.3.T: "Angkor Wat"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.3.D: "A temple complex built by King Suryavarman II (1113 - 1150). The complex contains over a thousand buildings spread over nearly 400 acres and is the peak of Khmer architecture. The city of Angkor was the royal center of the Khmer dynasty and the hub of one of the largest, most prosperous and most sophisticated kingdoms in SouthEast Asia. From the end of the 9th century to the beginning of the 13th various construction projects were carried out with Angkor Wat being one of them. Built by Suryavarman II as a massive funerary temple to hold his remains, construction is thought to have taken around three decades to complete. All of the original religious motifs were Hindu and the temple was dedicated to Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu. The five central towers of the temple symbolize Mount Meru which according to the Hindu mythology is the home of the Gods. The mountain is said to be in the middle of an ocean at the edge of the world. A 617 ft bridge sits at the entrance with it leading into three galleries, each separated by a paved walkway. The temple walls were covered with bas-relief carvings of high quality depicting Khmer history, Hindu gods and scenes from the epic Sanskrit poems Mahabharata and Ramayana. After the Cham people sacked Angkor in 1177 King Jayvarman VII (1181 - 1220) turned his back on the Hindu gods who had, in his mind, failed him and his people. He built a new capital nearby, Angkor Thom which he dedicated to Buddhism. Afterwards Angkor Wat became a Bhuddist shrine and many of the Hindu carvings and sculptures were replaced with Buddhist ones. By the early 15th century Angkor was largely abandoned, only maintained by Theravada Buddhist monks. It was "rediscovered" by the French in 1863. In the early 20th century various attempts at restoration were undertaken but they fell apart as the region was engulfed in war in the 1970s. When work resumed in the 1980s the repairs needed were even more extensive. Some sections had to be completely dismantled and rebuilt. In 1992 the Angkor complex, including Angkor Wat, was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list and added to the list of World Heritage in Danger. Afterwards restoration efforts accelerated and in 2004 Angkor was removed from the Heritage in Danger list. Today Angkor Wat is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in South East Asia and a popular tourist attraction, even appearing on the flag of Cambodia."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.4.T: "Ait Benhaddou"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.4.D: "A fortified village along the Saharan trade route between Marrakech and the Sahara and is a fantastic example of Morrocan earth clay architecture. The site of the city has been fortified since the 11th century and the Almoravid period. None of the buildings today date back to before the 17th century but were probably built with similar construction methods as the originals. The site's strategic importance was because of its location along one of the main Trans-Saharan trade routes. The Tizi n'Tichka Pass, which was accessed through this route, was one of the few across the Atlas Mountains and acted as a crossing between Marrakech and the Draa Valley on the edge of the Sahara. Today the area itself is only sparsely populated due to the valley's loss of importance over the 20th century. Most locals live in modern homes in the village across the river and make a living from agriculture and tourism. In 2011 a new bridge was built linking Benhaddou with the village aiming to make the two more accessible and hopefully encouraging people to move back into Benhaddou."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.5.T: "Bagan Temples"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.5.D: "Bagan or alternatively Pagan was founded probably in the mid to late 9th century by the Mranma who had recently entered the area even though legend says it was founded by the 2nd century. From 1044 to 1287 the city was the capital and beating heart of the Pagan Empire. Over a 250 year period nearly 10,000 religious monuments were built over a 40 square mile area. The city grew in prosperity and size and became an academic hub for the area with students coming from as far as India and Cambodia. The area's culture was heavily religious and a mix of all the prominent religions in the area including various Bhuddist and Hindu sects and local animist beliefs. While royal support would lead to Theravada Buddhists gaining prominence by the 11th century other religions would survive to varying degrees in the area. In 1287 the effects of Mongol invaders caught up with the city and it lost its prominence even if Mongol armies probably never reached the city itself. The city fell from a population of 50k - 200k to just a small town and was usurped in power by the Myinsaing Kingdom. The city survived as a pilgrimage destination with construction on new monuments slowing to just 200 built between the 15th and 20th centuries. Pilgrims flocked to a few notable monuments like the Ananda, the Shwezigon, the Sulamani and the Dhammayazika while the rest of them fell into disrepair and collapse. For those who hosted pilgrims however they continued to be upkept and even expanded with new frescos or statues added over time or even new additions to the temples themselves. A series of "sponsored additions'' during the Konbaung period (1752 - 1885) however added many things not true to original designs like plaster. During the 1990s the Burmese military government undertook a program to restore many remaining pagodas to boost the country's tourism industry. They were however condemned by restorationists for adding, among other things, a paved highway, watchtower and a golf course. Despite this, and numerous earthquakes, the site survives to this day and in 2019 was granted the title of World Heritage Site."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.6.T: "Baku Ateshgah"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.6.D: "The Fire Temple of Baku is a religious temple on the outskirts of Baku. Based on Persian and Indian writings the place had been used as a Hindu and Zoroastrian temple. The pentagon shaped complex, which has a courtyard surrounded by cells for monks and a tetrapilliar altar in the middle, was built in the 17th and 19th centuries. In the late 19th century it was abandoned, probably because of the declining Indian population of the area. The site's eternal flame went out in 1969 after the exhaustion of local gas reserves and is now lit by gas piped in from a nearby area. The Temple served as the philosophical center of Zoroastrianism for the area served by the Great Trunk Road trade route around the Caspian Sea. The four holy elements of Zoroastrian belief were: fire (ateshi), air (badi), abi (water), and earth (heki). However the temple was no longer used as a place of worship after 1883 after the gas industry moved into nearby Surakhany. The complex was made into a museum in 1975."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.7.T: "Borobudur Temple"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.7.D: "Borobudur was constructed between 778 and 850 by the Shailendra dynasty. From 1000 AD it was buried under ash and overgrown with plants when an English explorer re-discovered it in 1814. A team of Dutch archeologists restored the site between 1907 and 1911 and another restoration was finished in 1987. Built with around 2 million cubic feet of volcanic stone Borobudur encloses a small hill and is shaped like a stepped pyramid with three major levels, a square base, a middle level made of five square terraces and an upper level of three circular terraces totalling, in effect, 9 lesser sections as the number 9 is important in Buddhism. The center, rising 115 ft above the base, consists of a large stupa. Each of its three main levels represents a stage on the way to the Bodhisattva ideal of Enlightenment; as a symbol of this journey a visiting pilgrim begins at the eastern stairway and walks clockwise around each of the nine levels before reaching the top, a distance of nearly 3 mi. At the lowest level which is still partly hidden, there are hundreds of reliefs of earthly desires illustrating Kama-Dhatu or The Realm of Feeling, the lowest sphere of the Mahayana Buddhist universe. On the next level a series of reliefs show Rupa-Dhatu or the Realm of Form through the events of the life of the Gautama Buddha and scenes from the Jatakas which were stories from his previous lives. The upper level symbolizes Arupa-Dhatu or the Realm of Formlessness or detachment from the physical world. There is little decoration but lining the terraces are 72 bell shaped stupas, many still housing a statue of the Buddah partially visible through the opened stonework. During the Waisak ceremony which is performed once a year on the full moon thousands of saffron robed Buddhist monks walk in a solemn procession to Borobudur to remember the birth, death and enlightenment of the Buddah."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.8.T: "Bamiyan"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.8.D: "Bamiyan is on the Silk Road which runs through the Hindu Kush mountains and was the site of several Buddhist monasteries which were thriving centers of religion, philosophy and art. Monks at the monasteries lived as hermits in caves carved into the mountains with most of them decorating their caves with religious statues and frescoes sharing the culture of the region. Bamiyan however was a Buddhist religious center from the 2nd century up until the time of the Abbasid Caliphates invasion in 770. It again became a Bhuddist site in 870 and stayed so until the Muslims conquered the area again in 977. Murals in the nearby caves have been carbon dated to 438 - 980 suggesting Bhuddist activity continued up until the second conquest. The two most famous statues are of the Buddha Vairocana and Sakyamuni. The Buddah colloquially known as ''Solsol'' measures 55 meters tall and ''Shahnama'' stands 38 meters. Before being destroyed in 2001 by the Taliban they were the largest standing Buddahs in the world with both being built between 544 and 644. The monuments, mentioned by Chinese Buhddist pilgrim Xuanzang in April of 630 also mentions a reclining Buddah statue whose parts were reportedly found in 2008. In 2001 they were destroyed by the Taliban after much international outrage and efforts to rebuild them are ongoing."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.9.T: "Chichen Itza"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.9.D: "Chichen Itza was founded in the 6th century presumably by the Maya of the Yucatan Peninsula who had occupied the region since 1500 - 300 BC. The principle early buildings are done in the Puuc style which is a wild divergent style from other styles of the Southern lowlands. These early structures are south of the Main Plaza and include the Akab Dzib (House of the Dark Writing), Chichanchob (Red House), Iglesia (Church), Casa de las Monjas (Nursery), and the observatory El Caracol (The Snail). Evidence exists that after the Maya collapse in the 10th century Chichen was invaded by foreigners, probably Maya influenced by or under the direction of the Toltec of central Mexico. These invaders may have been the Itza for which the site is named however some also believe the Itza believe the Itza arrived 200 to 300 years later. Regardless of when they arrived, these invaders built some major buildings like El Castillo (The Castle), a 79ft pyramid rising above the Main Plaza. Castillo has four sides each with 91 stairs and facing a cardinal direction, including the step at the top platform that combines to a total of 365 steps, the same number of days in a year. During the spring and autumn equinoxes shadows cast by the setting sun make it look like a snake is going down the stairs. A carving of a plumed serpent at the top of the pyramid is symbolic of Quetzalcoatl (Kukulcan to the Maya), one of the major Mesoamerican deities. Excavations within the pyramid revealed another, earlier structure with a red jaguar throne studded with jade. Some other major buildings are the Ball Court (the largest in the Americas), The Temple of the Jaguars, the High Priest's Grave, the Thousand Columns and adjoining Temple of the Warriors. Most of these were built probably between 900 and 1200. From 1200 to 1540 Chichen Itza looks to have been eclipsed in power by the city of Mayapan. For a time Chichen Itza, Mayapan and Uxmal joined together in the League of Mayapan, a political confederacy. About 1450 the League fell apart as did Mayapan's political supremacy. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century the Maya were spread across many small towns but many major cities including Cichen Itza were abandoned. Long left to nature, Chichen Itza remains sacred to the Maya. Excavations began in the 19th century and it is one of Mexico's prime archaeological sites."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.10.T: "City of Khami"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.10.D: "Khami was the capital of the Torwa dynasty for around 200 years from around 1450 and looks to have been founded at the time of the dissolution of the state of Great Zimbabwe. After that, traditionally dated to 1683, it was sacked by the Rozvi and excavations indicate the site was abandoned after the Rozvi arrived. The Rozvi made another Khami stie, Dhlo-Dhlo their new capital and in 1830 they were pushed out of Khami by Ndeble raiders. The site reveals several built up areas occupied by royals with open valleys probably inhabited by commoners. The complex is made up of circular, sometimes terraced, artificial platforms shielded with dry, stone walls. The beautifully decorated retaining wall of the palace is covered with a checkered pattern along its entire length. The platforms rise 2 - 7m off the ground and carry clay huts and courtyards where the lower classes lived. The remnants of cattle corrals and huts for regular civilians can be found below the Hill Complex. The Hill Complex is a palace which had to have been on higher ground than the other buildings and had a Christian cross inside, placed by a missionary. There are also ruins on the eastern side of the Khami river. Other platforms are thought to be cattle corrals and another retaining wall with a checkered pattern."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.11.T: "Cologne Cathedral"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.11.D: "The site of the Cologne Cathedral has had a church on it since the 4th century. An older cathedral was destroyed in 1248 and upon its ruins the current cathedral was built which had a Gothic design to emulate French styles. The choir was consecrated in 1322 but construction continued into 1520 or 1560 depending on the source. The project then stalled for centuries with a large wooden crane left standing 184 ft on the top of the south tower. During the 1790s troops of Revolutionary France occupied Cologne and used the cathedral as a stable and hay barn. Restoration efforts began in 1820 spurred on by the Gothic Revival Movement. In 1842 a new cornerstone was laid by King Frederick William IV of Prussia and work to finish the cathedral really began. Construction was guided by plans made around 1300 and finished in 1880. At the time of its finishing the Cathedral was believed to be the largest structure on Earth, a record held for four years until the completion of the Washington Monument in the US. It continued to be the world's tallest religious building until the Ulm Cathedral was finished in 1890. Allied air raids badly damaged the building in 1944 but the medieval windows had been removed before then. By 1948 the choir was restored and it was again regularly used as was the rest of the interior by 1956. In the late 20th century work began to repair acid rain damage on its stonework. The Cathedral's art treasures are many and varied. Near its high altar sits the massive golden Shrine of the Three Kings said to contain relics of the Magi who visited baby Jesus. The shrine, a masterpiece of medieval goldwork, was begun in 1182 and finished around 1220 and was originally housed in its predecessor cathedral. The altarpiece in the Lady Chapel on the south wall of the choir is a triptych named The Adoration of the Magi and was finished in 1445 and made by Stefan Lochner, one of the most famous Cologne painters. The oldest stained glass windows in the Cathedral date back to the 13th century with the most recent being finished in 2007 to replace a window that was broken in WWII."

 FEE_Monuments_Events.12.T: "Hagia Sophia"
 FEE_Monuments_Events.12.D: "Built in just six years and finished in 537 the construction of the Hagia Sophia was rapid. Unusual for the period of its construction the names of the architects of the building, Anthemius and Isidorus, are well known as is their familiarity with mechanics and math. The Hagia Sophia contains a longitudinal basilica and a centralized building in an original manner with a huge 105 ft main dome supported by pendentives and two semi domes, one on either side of its longitudinal axis. In its plan the building is almost square with three aisles separated by columns with galleries above and marble piers to support the dome. The walls above the galleries and at the base of the Dome are covered with windows which in the daylight glare obscure the supports and make the canopy look to be floating. The original church on the site was said to be ordered by Constantine I in 325 on the foundations of a pagan temple. His son Constantinus II inaugurated it in 360. In 404 it was damaged by a fire started by a riot caused by the banishment of the Patriarch of Constantinople. It was rebuilt and expanded by Constans I with the restored building rededicated in 415 by Theodosius II. The church was again burned during the Nika riots in January of 532 giving Justinian the excuse for a grand replacement. The current building is essentially the 6th century building, although an earthquake in 558 caused a partial collapse of the dome which was restored in 562 followed by two smaller collapses which led to it being rebuilt to a smaller scale and being reinforced. In the mid 14th century it was again restored and for more than 1000 years it was the Cathedral of the Patriarch of Constantinople. In 1204 the Fourth Crusade led to the looting of the Cathedral along with most of Constantinople itself with many of its treasures being hauled back to Venice if not outright stolen. After the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II conquered Constantinople he had the church repurposed as a mosque and added wooden minarets, a grand chandelier, a mihrab which indicates the direction of Mecca and a minbar or pulpit. The red minaret which stands on the southwest corner of the Hagia was built either by him or his son Bayezid II. All the wooden minarets were eventually replaced. Bayezid II erected the narrow white one on the Northeast side of the mosque while the two identical western ones were commissioned by Selim II or Murad III in the 1500s. In 1934 Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, President of Turkey, secularized the building and in 1935 it was made a museum. Art historians say the building's mosaics are the main source of knowledge about the state of mosaic art just after the Iconoclast Controversy of the 8th and 9th centuries. In 1985 it became a UNESCO World Heritage site and in 2020, controversially, Tayyip Erdogan made the Hagia a mosque once more, holding prayers in it soon after even though visitors are still welcome."
