 FEE_France_Events.1.T: "French Feudalism and the Hundred Years’ War"
 FEE_France_Events.1.D: "In many of its aspects the institution of feudalism that defined medieval European life had its origins in France. During the 11th century, however, the “French Feudal Revolution” gave French feudalism a bewildering complexity that existed nowhere else in Europe, as holdings got broken down into ever smaller parts under the emergent classes of seigneurs and castellons. Some regions, such as Toulouse, were brought to heal, but most regions remained largely ruled by small powers with little control from Paris. \n\nThe agony of the Hundred Years’ War only increased the confusion, as allegiances between the various vassals fluctuated between the Valois and Plantagenet claimants to the throne. The expense of the war left France unable to enforce feudal obligations on several more prominent vassals, but also underlined the need for centralization to mount an effective defense against foreign aggression. To truly centralize France, however, centuries of tradition, laws, and feudal contracts would, sooner or later, need to be disregarded or destroyed…"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT1: "We must centralize the Kingdom of France!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT2: "We should remind our vassals of their military obligations!"
 FEE_France_Events.1.OPT3: "France is too vast to govern, we must preserve the feudal system!"

 FEE_France_Events.2.T: "Law Courts and Parlements"
 FEE_France_Events.2.D: "Power in France does not solely lie with the nobility, who exercise varying levels of independence from Paris. The rising class of lawyers, themselves centered in Paris, conduct much of the administration of the country with little oversight by the monarchy. Due to the inadequate road system, the further away from Paris the courts are, the less they tend to listen to the king. A properly unified administration of the nation must, of course, start here."
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT1: "We shall reign them in by any means necessary!"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT2: "Let us seek to reason with them: perhaps they will help us on their own"
 FEE_France_Events.2.OPT3: "§GLet the King Himself negotiate with these men§!"

 FEE_France_Events.3.T: "Regional Identities in France"
 FEE_France_Events.3.D: "France in the early modern period was a vast and populous land: by some measures the largest and most populous realm in the Western World, and certainly the largest to be claimed by one hereditary monarch, as opposed to the elective monarchy of the more populous but divided Holy Roman Empire. Despite the greater political unity, people in the various regions of France clung to their local identities rather than considering themselves Frenchmen, especially further away from the capital."
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT1: "It is time we create a France for the French! "
 FEE_France_Events.3.OPT2: "Let the provincials be themselves, I don’t care"

 FEE_France_Events.4.T: "Paris Seeks Control"
 FEE_France_Events.4.D: "Now that the war with England is finally over, instead of resting on their victory, it seems the French king has decided to curtail our God-given rights as local rulers and impose his own autocratic will on us. Needless to say, as semi-independent nobles in France, it falls to us to stand for the nobility across France and remind the King from whence his power comes."
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT1: "We must send a delegation to Paris to assert our rights!"
 FEE_France_Events.4.OPT2: "There is nothing we can really do"

 FEE_France_Events.5.T: "French Feudal Lords Oppose the King"
 FEE_France_Events.5.D: "Seeking to preserve their long-standing feudal prerogatives, the nobility remains a powerful force that largely opposes the recent royal efforts at centralization. Our recent efforts at increasing royal control have caused a delegation of France’s most powerful nobles, the semi-independent vassals of the crown, and others to approach the king and demand that our course be reversed."
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT1: "Ignore them!"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT2: "We can afford to reverse course a little"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT3: "Let us attempt to give carrots as well as sticks"
 FEE_France_Events.5.OPT4: "We must crush this arrogance now! "

 FEE_France_Events.6.T: "King Rejects our Demands"
 FEE_France_Events.6.D: "Our thinly veiled demand for protection of our rights and privileges was dismissed out-of-hand by the King in Paris. "
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT1: "Perhaps it is time we show the king who really holds power in France…"
 FEE_France_Events.6.OPT2: "We cannot contend with the King of France"

 FEE_France_Events.7.T: "Noble Leaders Arrested!"
 FEE_France_Events.7.D: "In an unexpected turn of events, the French king has responded in the worst way possible to our demands. Arresting some leaders and having others secretly killed, most of the delegation to Paris will not be returning to their extensive land holdings any time soon…"
 FEE_France_Events.7.OPT1: "§Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! will rue the day!"

 FEE_France_Events.8.T: "The Second Estate"
 FEE_France_Events.8.D: "While the nobility of France keep much of the King’s attention due to their vast land holdings and military power, the clergy are equally a political force to be reckoned with. At times the French clergy have controlled upwards of 40% of the nation’s wealth in endowments that under French law could only increase, never decrease. The French Crown did, at least wrest the power to appoint bishops and cardinals during the medieval Investiture crisis, but the clergy are also a more unified force in opposition to the king than the often-squabbling nobility. If [Root.Monarch.GetName] can leverage what concessions he already has, he can overcome the clergy’s resistance to centralization. If not…"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT1: "Seize Clergy Land and Curtail their Influence!"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT2: "Negotiate to gain their support for royal power"
 FEE_France_Events.8.OPT3: "Do not disturb the clergy"

 FEE_France_Events.9.T: "Clergy Refuses!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.D: "Our attempts at negotiating with the church have been met with arrogant dismissal at the hands of the leading clergymen of the realm. Saying that “your power comes from God just as ours does,” they refuse to relinquish any of their political power in our realm. In response to our attempts to use investiture to leverage influence, they have reignited the feud between church and king over the right to appoint church officials."
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT1: "Ingrates!"
 FEE_France_Events.9.OPT2: "This has gone far enough – the King of France rules the church!"

 FEE_France_Events.10.T: "Clergy Accepts"
 FEE_France_Events.10.D: "Our overtures were accepted by the Second Estate! Whether through respect for the divine rule of the king, or from fear of the king’s power over investiture, prominent clerics led a ceremony of reaffirmation of the French king’s authority over the church."
 FEE_France_Events.10.OPT1: "Wonderful!"
 
 FEE_France_Events.11.T: "Re-Trial of Jeanne D'Arc"
 FEE_France_Events.11.D: "In the year 1429, the Hundred years war was still raging on. With much of Northern France under the Anglo-Burgundian alliance, France was in a weak position. That same year, a peasant girl named Jeanne D'Arc, instructed by voices of angels, went into the royal court of Chinon where king Charles VII, along with many military leaders, to Orleans in order to defeat the English. In the ensuing battle, she earned the nickname 'Maid of Orleans'. Later on in her life, she helped the king be crowned at Reims, and led an unsuccessful attack to reclaim the city of Paris. In the year 1431, she was captured by the Burgundians who sold her to the English, and she was trialed and executed in the city of Rouen.\n\nNow, with the support of the Pope, the university of Paris, and the city of Rouen at our hand, the trial has been re-done, with over 115 witnesses testifying of the maid's purity. This will eliminate any claims that the kingdom was reclaim using a sorceress, thus removing any threats of undermining our legitimacy."
 FEE_France_Events.11.OPT1: "The English fops have been beaten once again."
