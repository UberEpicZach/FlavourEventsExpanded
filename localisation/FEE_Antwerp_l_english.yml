 fee_antwerp.2.tt: "La Furia Espanola"
 fee_antwerp.2.dd: "During the Eighty Years' War, or Dutch Revolt, the many Spanish tercios of the Army of Flanders under Julian Romero, employed to purge the anti-Catholic heresy and bring the rebel provinces of Holland and Zeeland back into line were growing restless. They were weary of endless fighting with little to no rest, and frustrated at their lack of pay by the Spanish Crown. The troops had their pay delayed due to Spain's recent declaration of bankruptcy, leading to the bankers refusing to authorise payment until they had negotiated with Phillip II. This meant that the King had to send the physical money by sea, which was much more perilous. To make matters worse, 400,000 florins intended for the soldiers were seized by the English after the ships carrying them were forced to take refuge in English ports during a storm. This pushed the tercios too far. They decided to find their pay for themselves, as was a time old tradition, by sacking a major city. They chose the de facto capital of the Seventeen Provinces at the time, Antwerp, from which to take what they were owed. This was due to the treachery of the Spanish commander of Antwerp Citadel, Sancho d'Avila. He attempted to convince the commander of the garrison of German mercenaries to deliver the city into Spanish hands. This, however, had the opposite effect. The Germans began to improvise defences against the Spaniards and a day before the mutinying tercios arrived, 6,000 Walloon mercenaries were let into the city to help defend it. This was not enough, unfortunately for the city and its citizens. The defences were overrun by the professionally trained soldiers and the Walloon troops not only failed to defend the city, but even fled or participated in the looting ofAntwerp. The few remaining Germans and the civilians were massacred, some 7,000 lives lost."

 fee_antwerp.3.tt: "The Spanish Fury"
 fee_antwerp.3.dd: "The treacherous Spaniards have sacked Antwerp! Those uncouth dogs have destroyed the jewel of the Netherlands, and we must take revenge. We are called upon by God to avenge the deaths of these innocents, and to punish the Spanish for their tyranny and insolence! For now, bury the dead and repair the damage. This is truly a death knell for Antwerp and a black day for our people."
