 FEE_Bohemia.3.T: "Death of Jiri Podebrad"
 FEE_Bohemia.3.D: "Jiri Podebrad died in 1471, in the middle of his struggle with Mathias Corvinus of Hungary whonheaded a 'crusade' against Bohemia and claimed its throne. Since his supporters were in a precarious military situation, having lost all lands of the Bohemian Crown to the King of Hungary, Podebrad had shortly before his death, despite being the father of several adult sons himself, asked prince Vladislav of Poland to succeed him in order to save Hussitism and Bohemian independence, already experienced in war over in his days in Poland.. Vladislav indeed succeeded him and initiated a half-century of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia which proved to be backwards, intolerant in religious matters, devastating for Bohemia's economy and eventually resulted in the disaster of 1526. However had Podebrad been in a better situation, he might very well have used the opportunity to establish his dynasty as hereditary national Kings of Bohemia."

 FEE_Bohemia.5.T: "Death of Matthias Corvinus"
 FEE_Bohemia.5.D: "In the last years of his reign, Matthias Corvinus tried to ensure the succession of his highly gifted, but illegitimate son Janos, made him the largest landholder in Hungary after the King by several grants of territory, put him in charge of several of the strongest and most important fortresses, gave him the holy crown of St. Stephen and got a majority of the royal council to support Janos. However Matthias Corvinus died of a stroke before the matter was definitely secured, and the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Matthias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490 and immediately thereafter accepted the compact of Farkashida in which he confirmed all existing privileges of the nobility and took back all legal and administrative reforms, including the efficient system of taxation regarded as repressive by the magnates. After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Another candidate to the throne was Maximilian of Habsburg who maintained the claim of his father Friedrich III, but since he had already proven to be a capable ruler and would have been likely to use his powerbase in the Empire, Austria and Burgundy to consolidate his authority in Hungary, he was no popular choice. Had Janos Corvinus indeed managed to become King, he might have continued the achievements of his father but would have been violently opposed by the powerful magnates."

 FEE_Bohemia.5.OPT2: "Janos Corvinus shall be King!"

 FEE_Bohemia.6.T: "Wladyslaw Jagiello, King of Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia.6.D: "Matthias Corvinus of Hungary died in 1490. It had been his explicit wish to let his illegitimate son Janos succeed him, however, when Corvinus was dead, the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Matthias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471.

 FEE_Bohemia.7.T: "Civil War in Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia.7.D: "After Matthias Corvinus of Hungary's sudden death, a bitter conflict over his succession has arisen. Following his explicit wish, his illegitimate son Janos has been crowned King, however, there is considerable resistance among the magnates who are fed up with strong royal authority and high taxes. They have decided to revolt against the new King in order to protect their interest. Meanwhile, Friedrich III still bears the title King of Hungary and he and his son Maximilian are regarded by some Hungarians as the legitimate successor to the throne. Taking advantage of the conflict within it, it might be easy to press the claim and conquer Hungary now."
 FEE_Bohemia.7.OPT1: "Claim the Hungarian Throne!"
 FEE_Bohemia.7.OPT2: "We have imperial issues."

 FEE_Bohemia.8.T: "The Kingdom of Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia.8.D: "The Kingdom of Hungary has elected a new monarch, [HUN.Monarch.GetName], who lacks the support of a huge part of the nobility. There can be expected to be a long internal struggle, a pit of chaos which would probably give the Sultan an excellent opportunity to expand north."
 FEE_Bohemia.8.OPT1: "Chaos is not a pit, Chaos is a ladder."
