 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.1.T: "Whispers of the Past"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.1.D: "It began with the Medes and Elamites. Long ago, our people arose out of the dusty hills of Persia. We, the chosen children of the Eternal Fire, awoke from our long slumber and realized we were strong. Many rulers, armies, and battles receded into legend, and legend became myth… And yet the spirit of the Persians endured.\n\nThe armies of the Mohammadens tried their utmost to snuff out that spirit in us and impose their bickering sects on us. Even the barbarians of the east from Genghis to Timur trod on our people and tried to mold us after their own image. And yet, we endured. However, the damage to our land, our culture, and our ways was severe, and much that should not have been forgotten was lost. And yet…\n\nOur priests search tirelessly through the few remaining archives of old, trying to rescue as much from the ashes as they can. One of them made a startling discovery…"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.1.OPT1: "What? What is it? Tell me at once!"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.1.OPT2: "I'm sure it's nothing..."

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.2.T: "The Heirs of Yazdegerd"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.2.D: "\"My Lord, do you recall what happened to the last Shahanshah before the Caliphate invaded?\"\n\n\"Of course, how could I forget the doomed Yazdegerd. An ignominious end for a tragic man. What about him?\"\n\n\"Well yes, my lord, but did you know he had an heir, an heir that survived the downfall of Erenshahr?\"\n\nAt the very words, the breeze that blew through the courtyard seemed just that much colder… \"An heir you say? But his last son died in exile in China.\"\n\n\"Yes… But there is more to the story, survived from the House of Wisdom. The line of Khosrau endured in China and he had another son there, Bahram by name. But from here he disappears into mystery; only in China would there be more knowledge. We must know more about this. If we were to recover the rightful King of Kings, then our empire's security would be assured!\"\n\nYou think for a minute… Of course, if they were to find him it would force you off the throne you fought for so fiercely. However, they could very well find nothing, and it would be a shame to make an enemy of [Adm_Advisor.GetName]."
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.2.OPT1: "Of course. Sponsor an expedition at once!"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.2.OPT2: "Persia has no Sassanids... Persia needs no Sassanids"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.3.T: "Scholars Received in [700.GetName]"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.3.D: "Dusty travellers from the east are far from news in [700.GetName], China's doorway to the Silk Road. It is not every day, however, that the travellers demand to speak to the regional governor, claiming to be scholars on an urgent mission from the King of Kings, a lofty title that matches that of the Son of Heaven himself. Of course, the governor quickly verified that they did come from the newly reestablished Empire of the Persians. Of course, the courier system quickly brought the news to the Imperial Court, and the delegation was invited before us.\n\nIt seems they are seeking to find a long-lost descendant of their dynasty, believing he may be still living in [700.GetName]. They petition the Emperor to search whatever records of him may have survived the warlords and the Mongols since then, or indeed whether the family itself survived such depredations.\n\nNaturally, should they find their long-lost king, there would be both risks and potential opportunities…"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.3.OPT1: "Send our best scholars and anything else they need!"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.3.OPT2: "Allow them to conduct their search, but this matter is beneath us"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.3.OPT3: "King of Kings? Who do these brigands think they are? Banish them!"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.4.T: "Scholars Received in [700.GetName]"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.4.D: "Dusty travellers from the east are far from news in [700.GetName], China's doorway to the Silk Road. It is not every day, however, that the travellers demand to speak to the regional governor, claiming to be scholars on an urgent mission from the King of Kings.\n\nOf course, anyone making such a claim had to be brought to [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] in order to speak with the Khan personally. For we are all under the same great blue heaven and our Khan must be the final judge of whether such requests receive heaven's favour.\n\nWhat is the Khan's decision?"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.4.OPT1: "They shall have our aid, but first they must swear fealty to the Khan"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.4.OPT2: "King of Kings? Pah! There is only one Great Khan, and it is not these upstarts!" # "Let their king save them from my sword then!" was cut for making the option too long
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.4.OPT3: "The Persians are our friends after all. We will permit them their search."

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.5.T: "Scholars Received in [700.GetName]"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.5.D: "Dusty travellers from the east are far from news in [700.GetName], China's doorway to the Silk Road. It is not every day, however, that the travellers demand to speak to the regional governor, claiming to be scholars on an urgent mission from the King of Kings.\n\nOf course, in the chaos that has engulfed much of the Chinese lands, it is hard to know who the appropriate person to hear their request even is. The governor of [700.GetName] decided to take matters into his own hands, granting them permission to the ancient imperial archives of the old Chang'An."
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.5.OPT1: "He has done well. Reward him!"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.5.OPT2: "He has exceeded his authority. Execute him!"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.6.T: "Aid from the Emperor"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.6.D: "A courier arrived by the fastest horses from China today. A message from the Celestial Emperor himself accompanied him. The translator quickly unrolled the scroll and read the response to our expedition:\n\n\"Thus says the Son of Heaven: we remember the Kings of Old in Anxi. Our empire welcomes your search, and our most skilled archivists shall aid in your endeavours. We only hope that you find what you need. We are prepared to host yours as honoured guests of our household, holding them in high honor as representatives of the great Lords of Anxi, who we once saw as equals.\""
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.6.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.7.T: "The Emperor Gives Permission"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.7.D: "We received a message from our scholars dispatched from Persia today.\n\nEagerly, the Shah opened the letter to see the contents:\n\n\"We passed swiftly along the old roads to China. In the former days, scholars had been well received here, Persians most of all. Some still attest to the ancient days when Persian envoys were honoured guests in the city. Less welcome have they shown us than in days of old, and only grudgingly did they permit us to search among their hoarded scrolls and books. The Emperor himself deigned to respond to our requests, although not as a friend as old:\n\n\"'If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of the ancient days, and the beginnings of our city, then read on!' We were told by messengers directly from the Emperor. 'For to me what is past is less pressing than what is to come. But unless you have more skill than Confucius, who studied here long, you will find little that is not well known to me, the master of the lore of China.'\""
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.7.OPT1: "The courtesy of their halls is somewhat lessened of late..."

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.8.T: "Imperial Rejection"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.8.D: "We received a message from our scholars dispatched from Persia today.\n\nEagerly, the Shah opened the letter to see the contents:\n\n\"We passed swiftly along the old roads to China, and we are still present in the city of Xian for now. We relayed your wishes to the Imperial court, and were invited to the imperial court, only for this reply to be relayed by us to your majesty:\n\n\"'You, O King, live beyond the confines of many hills and valleys; nevertheless, impelled by your humble desire to partake of the benefits of our civilisation, you have dispatched a mission respectfully bearing your memorial. You're Envoy has crossed the deserts and paid his respects at my Court on the anniversary of my birthday. I have perused your memorial: the earnest terms in which it is couched reveal a respectful humility on your part, which is highly praiseworthy. In consideration of the fact that your Ambassador and his deputy have come a long way with your memorial and tribute, I have shown them high favour and have allowed them to be introduced into my presence. To manifest my indulgence, I have entertained them at a banquet and made them numerous gifts.\n'As to your entreaty to send one of your nationals to be accredited to my Celestial Court and to examine the archives of China, this request is contrary to all usage of my dynasty and cannot possibly be entertained. It is true that barbarians, in the service of the dynasty, have been permitted to live at Peking, but they are compelled to adopt Chinese dress, they are strictly confined to their own precincts and are never permitted to return home. You are presumably familiar with our dynastic regulations. Your proposed Envoy to my Court could not be placed in a position similar to that of other barbarian officials in Peking who are forbidden to leave China, nor could he, on the other hand, be allowed liberty of movement and the privilege of corresponding with his own country; so that you would gain nothing by his residence in our midst.\n'Moreover, our Celestial dynasty possesses vast territories, and tribute missions from the dependencies are provided for by the Department for Tributary States, which ministers to their wants and exercises strict control over their movements. It would be quite impossible to leave them to their own devices. Supposing that your Envoy should come to our Court, his language and national dress differ from that of our people, and there would be no place in which to bestow him. It may be suggested that he might imitate the foreigners permanently resident in Peking and adopt the dress and customs of China, but, it has never been our dynasty's wish to force people to do things unseemly and inconveniently. Besides, supposing I sent an Ambassador to reside in your country, how could you possibly make for him the requisite arrangements? The world consists of many other nations besides your own: if each and all demanded to be represented at our Court, and to be allowed to view our documents, how could we possibly consent? The thing is utterly impracticable. How can our dynasty alter its whole procedure and system of etiquette, established for more than a century, in order to meet your individual views?'\n'It may be, O King, that the above proposals have been wantonly made by your Ambassador on his own responsibility, or peradventure you yourself are ignorant of our dynastic regulations and had no intention of transgressing them when you expressed these wild ideas and hopes.... If, after the receipt of this explicit decree, you lightly give ear to the representations of your subordinates and allow your barbarian subjects to proceed to Chêkiang and Tientsin, with the object of landing and trading there, the ordinances of my Celestial Empire are strict in the extreme, and the local officials, both civil and military, are bound reverently to obey the law of the land. Should your vassals reach these lands, your subjects will assuredly never be permitted to stay or to reside there, but will be subject to instant expulsion. In that event your barbarian merchants will have had a long journey for nothing. Do not say that you were not warned in due time! Tremblingly obey and show no negligence! . . .'\"\n\n    - The Son of Heaven, Lord of Ten Thousand Years, Emperor of all under Heaven" # probably too long
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.8.OPT1: "So it ends..."
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.8.OPT2: "Who is this Emperor to deny the King of Kings? If he will not give us what we want, we shall take it"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.9.T: "Khan demands our Submission"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.9.D: "The dust pillar heralded the rider long before he himself was visible, or the dry thuds of his mount's hooves could be heard. A nimble horse of the steppes, it was clearly one from the Khanate and not one of the heavier steeds of the Persian court. The rider was equally alien to the customs of the peripheral palace the Shah was staying at; rough woollen cloth with plentiful fur trim, he remained unphased by the silks and cottons of the whispering courtiers who eyed his as he approached the throne after a signal from the Shah's chancellor.\n\n\"The Khan of Khans has considered your request and hereby sends this reply\" the messenger proclaimed in slurred but unmistakable Persian. \"He dispatches this letter written by his own hand to your court, written in your tongue to show the Khan's grace and forbearance.\"\n\nThe Shahanshah opened the letter:\n\n\"We, by the power of the eternal heaven, Khan of the great Ulus, Our command…\n\n\"You must say with a sincere heart: "We will be your subjects; we will give you our strength". You must in person come with your kings, all together, without exception, to render us service and pay us homage. Only then will we acknowledge your submission and grant the requests of your envoys and scholars. And if you do not follow the order of Heaven, and go against our orders, we will know you as our enemy.\""
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.9.OPT1: "We hear, and reluctantly obey. Let us go before the Khan"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.9.OPT2: "Pah! Let this barbarian \"Khan\" make himself known to me... As for you, you cur..."

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.10.T: "Scholars Murdered!"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.10.D: "The grunting of camels, the clink of scaled armour, and the gutteral sounds of the nomadic horsemen speaking amongst themselves filled the ears of the gatekeepers as they let them pass through to the courtyard just outside the Shah's palace. The Shah came out from the inner courts to stand on the balcony overlooking the Khan's messengers. He eyed the rough camel hair sack the messengers carried with them. Its crude construction made it unlikely to be a gift from the steppe dwellers, but clearly what lay inside was intended for him.\n\nSuddenly, the lead horseman spurred his mount towards the guards, causing them to tense and grip their spears at the ready. The envoy laughed a rumbling, low pitched laugh, then proceeded to prance his nimble steed around the courtyard, never taking his eyes off the Shah.\n\n\"The Khan of Khans has received your messages, and hereby grants you this boon\" he shouted up at the balcony. \"Know that you are foremost in his thoughts, and he wishes you to see, and seeing, to understand!\"\n\nOn his signal, the other horsemen grabbed the large sack and overturned it, toppling out its content with a series of dull thuds. The Shah's courtiers leaped to their feet, many gasping as the severed heads of the scholars and chaperones of the expedition revealed themselves.\n\nA second signal from the envoy, and the nomads wheeled and dashed through the gates before the command to seize them could be given. Clear through the gates they thundered at a speed no Persian cavalryman could match, and soon disappeared back into the steppe from whence they came. Only the grisly sight of the once-respected heads remained… The loss of these great minds will surely be a much greater blow to the empire than the individuals themselves."
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.10.OPT1: "Curses!"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.11.T: "Khan Grants Our Request"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.11.D: "We received a message from our scholars dispatched from Persia today.\n\nEagerly, the Shah opened the letter to see the contents:\n\n\"We arrived in Xi'an and all is well. The Khan, despite lacking scholars, has understood the need for our mission, and been gracious enough to permit our search!\""
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.11.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.12.T: "Aid from the East"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.12.D: "My Shahanshah,\n\nWe treated with the governor of the Xi'an prefecture, and his approval of our request was upheld by the lord of the land, who gave us access to what resources he can spare. We do not know how long we will be able to work, due to the turmoil engulfing these lands, but for now we proceed unimpeded. The potential that our messages will be intercepted prevents our more detailed correspondence."
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.12.OPT1: "And now, we wait..."

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.13.T: "Aid Stopped"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.13.D: "My Shahanshah,\n\nWe treated with the governor of the Xi'an prefecture, but we do not know how long we will be able to stay here and study. The governor proved friendly, but his liege ordered that his resources be restricted from helping us, and the turmoil that engulfs China means we may be forced to leave at any time. Regardless, we will do what we can. The potential that our messages will be intercepted prevents our more detailed correspondence."
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.13.OPT1: "They have passed out of our sight now..."

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.14.T: "An Heir is Revealed"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.14.D: "A breathless messenger burst through the heavy double doors of the summer palace. \"My Lord! A letter from the scholars in China! They requested all speed to deliver the same to yourself!\"\n\nWith hands slightly trembling due to the surprise of the moment and the obvious portents of such an urgent letter, the Shahanshah unscrolled the paper.\n\n\"All that is gold does not glitter,\nNot all those who wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not wither,\nDeep roots are not reached by the frost.\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken,\nA light from the shadows shall spring;\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken,\nThe crownless again shall be king.\"\n\nThough cryptic to avoid deciphering, the meaning of the words were unmistakable to the Shah. The long lost heir to the Sassanid dynasty had been found, and the expedition, so fraught with danger and risk of failure, had been a success."
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.14.OPT1: "The Heir of Khosrau yet lives?"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.15.T: "Expedition Ends in Failure"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.15.D: "The stars are covered over tonight, as a rare night of clouds makes the customary stargazing hour impossible this evening. And yet, they bring a pleasant cool to the air, leading the Shahanshah to spend this evening on the observatory roof.\n\n\"Perhaps it was never meant to be\" he mused at the magi beside him. The news of their failure to find anything in their search did not exactly come as a surprise, but it did represent a great failure in leadership on his part.\n\nThe man, now considerably aged by his long journey, sighed. \"It must have been the will of Ahura Mazda… All we have now is to decide what we shall do with the time we have now for us.\"\n\n\"You speak truth\" the Shah replied. \"If we cannot restore the glory of ages past, we can build a new age of our own…\""
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.15.OPT1: "Let the past lie."

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.16.T: "An Audience with the Khan"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.16.D: "The distant rumble of a throat-singing bard, the strum of a steppe stringed instrument, the sour odour of kumis, the neighing of innumerable horses, the cold dry wind, and the sight of the Khan's great camp turned capital all competed for the Shahanshah's attention. Equally, his entourage attracted curious looks from the villagers, warriors, and foreign delegates alike, as his horse, larger than all but the largest steppe horses, made its way through the crowd, with guards flanking either side clearing the way and carts with relatively few but fine quality gifts for the Khan brought up the rear.\n\n\"Enter and pay homage to your Khan!\" The guard gestured to him. Knowing the fearsome reputation of the steppe lords, the Shahanshah couldn't help but feel a cold grip work its way up his spine as he entered the oversized tent. Is all of this really worth it, just to get permission to search through some musty archives? The thought of paying homage to a tent dwelling uncultured barbarian galled him, but it's too late to turn back now…"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.16.OPT1: "Hail to the Lord of the Heavens"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.16.OPT2: "You stink of horse..."

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.17.T: "Nobles Push Back"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.17.D: "Although much celebration accompanied the long-lost heir of Khosrau on his return to the capital, it did not take long for tensions to emerge. Of particular note was the fact that, despite his lofty ancestry, Juluo himself is still a product of his birth; a Chinese of middling means and education unfamiliar with the ways of the Persian court. Spies warned us of a faction against the heir brewing among the most elite of the court, but its true scale was only revealed when a crowd of nobles marched into the courtroom, with the Grand Vizier at their head.\n\n\"What would a mere foreigner know of being the Shah?\" he sneered uncharacteristically. \"For generations my family has faithfully served this crown, and you would simply toss away its dignity on this churl? Persia has no Sassanid. Persia needs no Sassanid.\""
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.17.OPT1: "He is your Shah and the rightful heir of the empire!"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.17.OPT2: "Perhaps he is right... We can do just fine on our own"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.18.T: "Learning One's Roots"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.18.D: "Certainly, few could have had a more jarring shift in life than the now Shahanshah of Persia. Plucked from his birth home in China, surviving revolts and assassinations, and now lord of one of the most powerful empires on earth, it would have been an accomplishment for anyone.\n\nAnd yet… The dissonance between himself and the culture of his birth with the sophisticated and still foreign culture of the court he ruled rankled Juluo. It was an issue which, although the cause of outright civil war, was never fully resolved.\n\n\"Enough of this indecision!\" He suddenly snapped, startling his secretary, alone with him in the chambers. \"I must decide once and for all who I am.\""
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.18.OPT1: "Bring me the finest Persian scholars! I will recover my ancestral culture"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.18.OPT2: "Persia can learn much from my time in the East! I shall remain between two worlds"

 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.19.T: "The Silk Road reborn"
 FEE_Eranshahr_Events.19.D: "The rebirth of the Sassanid dynasty sent shock waves throughout the Near East and into the Far East. While the states of Arabia reacted with rage and fear, others were more mixed in their response. Despite their initial scepticism of the claim, the rulers of China especially were keen to recultivate ties with their allies of long ago, and readily acknowledged the empire as an equal to their own, an honor reserved only for the Persian empire of old and for the long-gone Romans. The Celestial Emperor commissioned a new Persian Bureau to match the Bureau of Barbarians, and with the rise of a \"civilised\" partner at last, the hope of renewed overland trade, long devastated by centuries of horde invasions, could be seen.\n\nEfforts by both empires to renew and rebuild the long-neglected Silk Road began in earnest."
