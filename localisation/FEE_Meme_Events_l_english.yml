FEE_Meme_Events.1.tt: "Flavour Events Expanded Memes"
FEE_Meme_Events.1.dd: "Some events are of a lighter hearted nature and do not seriously depict real world circumstance. These events might be immersion breaking for people looking for more serious gameplay. By enabling meme events you agree that you won't come to the mods expanded discord and complain about how Bill Wurtz events aren't funny."
FEE_Meme_Events.1.a: "I love fun, I promise I won't complain about these events in an hour."
FEE_Meme_Events.1.b: "No, I take myself very seriously and have over 150000 hours in this game."
