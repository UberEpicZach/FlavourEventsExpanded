 FEE_Deccan_Events.1.T: "A New Capital"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.1.D: "After careful consideration, we have determined that the original capital, Junnar, no longer fulfils the needs of our growing realm. Despite its fortifications, its isolated location and lack of proximity to major trade routes make it unsuitable for our grand vision. Under the direction of our esteemed Grand Vizier, a thorough search was conducted to find an ideal location for our new capital. We have chosen the village of Bhingar for this purpose. This site will be completely transformed from its humble beginnings. The existing village will be levelled, and construction will commence on our majestic new capital: Ahmadnagar. Ahmednagar will be a city built from the ground up, a shining jewel of our realm. It will be a place of inspiration and awe, a city fit for a king, and a testament to the grandeur of our Sultan. Let it be known that Ahmednagar will stand as a beacon of our aspirations and the embodiment of our glorious future."
 FEE_Deccan_Events.1.OPT1: "Ro... Ahmadnagar wasn't built in a day."
 FEE_Deccan_Events.1.OPT2: "No, I want it now!"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.1.OPT3: "Our current capital is adequate."

 FEE_Deccan_Events.2.T: "Public Water Network"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.2.D: "The great city of Bijapur ever more becomes the greatest metropolitan of India rivalling the great cities of the ganges. Becoming ever more a sea of buildings and monuments, the people cry out. The city has not only lost its prestige and beautiful allure in this race for rapid urbanisation and growth. This combined with a lack of public infrastructure and access to drinking water due to the rapid expansion of the city has caused major discontent in the population, from the highest to the lowest classes. This outcry for a higher quality of life and mainly the fear of over a million people revolting poised the leadership of [Root.GetName] to take action. The plan consisted of four phases. The first phase would be to install a city wide public water system that would supply everyone with clean drinking water. This would happen via public fountains and, for those willing to pay a premium and a maintenance fee, even to their houses. Secondly the introduction of public parks and water pavilions, which are in effect a set of regular parks filled with artificial rivers, ponds and lakes to help cool down the city. These parks would also function as natural filters for the water system based on the same system that existed in pre Mongol Baghdad. Of course a large part of these were reserved for the richer neighbourhoods with a few communal ones installed to cool those neighbourhoods too. The last phase was to construct a large number of bath houses mainly aimed at appeasing the middle and lower classes for being left out of the parks and water pavilion projects. This however did not mean that the rich would be excluded, while it is true that most of the bathhouses would be aimed for the middle and lower class, they would be much more bare bones then those in the rich parts of the city. For every 10 regular ones they would erect 1 luxury one. For example, these regular bath houses would be a combination of Islamic and Roman building philosophy on the matter. As in a collection of hot temperate and cold pools combined with saunas and hammams. Lastly to prevent this problem from ever arising again they would institute a sort of civil guideline or blueprint for how to expand the city next. Creating cookie cutter city blocks on paper to add to the city each time expansion was required. Making the city seem rather modular, but would work very effectively to circumvent these problems regarding urbanisation ever again."
 FEE_Deccan_Events.2.OPT1: "Whatever it costs."
 FEE_Deccan_Events.2.OPT2: "Maybe we can cut some corners?"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.2.OPT3: "On second thought, nevermind."

 FEE_Deccan_Events.3.T: "The Hundred Bazaars"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.3.D: "With a great influx in people comes both an influx in the needs of these same people and the amount of artisans in the cities. The internal trade then attracted more outside trade as well which grew the international importance of Bijapur as a centre of trade. This all culminated into a unregulated market mess within the cities with little shops and ramshackle markets all over this city increasing crime, scammers and all other forms of overstimulated uncontrolled economic practices. To handle both these amounts of goods and trade being done within the city the metropolitan government needed to intervene and do an attempt at regulating the matter. This is when it created the system of “Hundred Bazaars”, which basically means any form of interaction that involves the trade of goods for goods, money for goods and money for services. Should and could only be done in one of the official taxed and policed Hundred bazaars within the city. This allowed the authorities to protect the safety of traders, artisans and customers alike. While cracking down on crime and maintaining a form of quality for the good being sold. While some argued that this would curb economic growth the exact opposite happened. It skyrocketed the trade influence of the city and the amount of economic worth of the city. The effect was so profound that the currency of Bijapur would become the dominant currency from the Bengal delta to the Coromandels, even being accepted as valid valuta as far as persia and china. Traders across Asia and even parts of Europe would flock and fight for a place and the right to trade in one of the bazaars of Bijapur. This increased our population even more and with more population and more money comes even more cultural importance and power. According to some philosophers of the Subcontinent we have all but become the true capital of Hindustan, or Bharat, whichever floats your boat."
 FEE_Deccan_Events.3.OPT1: "Spend money to make money!"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.3.OPT2: "I prefer 'free' trade."
 FEE_Deccan_Events.3.OPT3: "Sounds like a southern capital to me!"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.3.OPT4: "It's no Dehli, but it shall be the second city of the Empire."

 FEE_Deccan_Events.4.T: "Cultural Center for the Deccan"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.4.D: "Starting with the Bahmani sultans who saw tremendous potential in the then very humble city of Bijapur, the city was slowly treated more and more like a regional capital if not even a second capital. It would be Bahmani most prestigious governor's post, and often be exclusively given to the grand vizier. This focus would turn it slowly over time into the cultural centre of the Deccan. This idea would be continued by the Adil Shahi dynasty of the Bijapur sultanate, and later on even the Mughals. This gave rise during the Deccan Sultanates period to the greatest artistic institutions and streams of the Deccan. This included institutions like the Persianate schools of Music and painting, and the art of Deccani weaving which combined Persian and Indian weaving in one art style. While the other sultanates and cities of the Bahmani sultanate like Golconda and Berar would, in effect, inherit the state system diamond industry and military concepts, Bijapur as a city would continue to exercise itself as the trade and cultural centre of the entire Deccan. The city would become such an influential centre of Persianate culture that it would be nicknamed as “little Persia.” Its influence however did not end there. By 1600 nearly all agreed that Bijapur had become the economic capital of the entire subcontinent. No where else would so much trade nor inter cultural connection happen for the subcontinent then in Bijapur."
 FEE_Deccan_Events.4.OPT1: "Glory to us, am I right, People?"

 FEE_Deccan_Events.5.T: "The Darush-Shafa"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.5.D: "In the ever flourishing environment that was fostered in Bijapur, the concept of the modern hospital and medical institutions we know today would find its genesis. A Darush-Shafa would be very comparable to what we today call a university research hospital. The concept is rather simple in hindsight but would be revolutionary for its time. The concept is simple diseases are categorised in different divisions: skin, fever, ear, blood, brain, bones and internal ailments. Each department headed by a specialist surgeon in the specific field who would managed a set of specialised doctors who would then in turn train new physicians. The standard nursing duties would usually be performed by members of the clergy estate be it hindu or islam each having their own wings of course. The specialisation wouldn't end here however each specialist would also pick a school of medicine to specialise. The main four schools to specialise in where: Unani, Ayurvedic, Irani and European systems of medicine. Unani being the Perso-Arabic form of medicine born out of the golden age of islam, Ayurvedic medicine also known as standard Vedic medicine, Irani medicine which finds its roots from ancient persia being born out of the Sassanian golden age. Lastly european medicine which would arrive in india via venetian traders in the 12th and 13th centuries and would continue to find its way into the Indian subcontinent via the ottoman empire and russian and caucasian traders. The Unani and European form of medicine would usually only be used by the muslims who had far more strict rules that applied to the human body. These institutions would also pioneer the first form of modern surgery even going so far as having the very first open brain surgery, and we aren't talking of cutting a hole in the skull here to alleviate the pressure. They would actually successfully operate on the brain for the very first time in human history, removing a tumour successfully while the patient survived the procedure. In these operating rooms they would also pioneer cleanliness of both environment tools and surgeons which was not only controversial but considered stupid in many fields of medicine. However all forms of medicine were available to everyone for a price of course. While the poor were dependent on the willingness of the clerical estate to pay for their treatment. It's important to remember that these hospitals weren't clerical institutions. These hospitals were royal institutions subsidised by the crown for research and to keep the general population healthy. The clergy were mainly expected to help out due to their social obligations. This would be a win win for the cron allowing them to keep their population and nobility in peak condition while trying to prevent plagues. While also allowing the crown to exercise some form of social and real control over the clergy."

 FEE_Deccan_Events.6.T: "Ratirahasya - How to please a King"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.6.D: "Also known as the Medieval Kama Sutra, The "Ratirahasya" was a comprehensive guide to the art of love and the subtleties of romantic relationships. It was not merely a manual but a poetic and philosophical exploration of human intimacy. It meticulously detailed the various aspects of love, including physical attraction, emotional connection, and the intricate rituals of courtship. This work drew from earlier texts like the "Kama Sutra" and other classical literature, weaving together ancient wisdom with his own insights. It described the different types of women and men, their characteristics, and how they could best connect with one another. It offered guidance on enhancing physical beauty, techniques for passionate lovemaking, and the importance of mutual respect and understanding in sustaining a loving relationship. The "Ratirahasya" also delved into the significance of astrological compatibility and the influence of the seasons and times of day on romantic encounters. The work became immensely popular in the courts and among the nobility of mediaeval India. It was celebrated for its eloquent prose, profound wisdom, and the delicate balance it struck between sensuality and spirituality. The "Ratirahasya" was not just a guide to physical intimacy but a celebration of love as a sacred and transformative experience. Over the centuries, the "Ratirahasya" influenced various aspects of Indian culture, from literature and art to the social norms surrounding relationships and marriage."

 FEE_Deccan_Events.7.T: "Expanding Golkonda Fort"
 FEE_Deccan_Events.7.D: "During the reign of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, who held Golkonda as their capital, Golkonda Fort was expanded no less than three times in 60 years.\nIt went from being an old-style mud fort, to becoming a massive fortification of granite. It would serve as the seat of Qutb Shahi power until the capital was moved to Hyderabad in the late 16th century, and remain an important fortification until the Mughals tore it down a century later."

 FEE_Deccan_Events.8.D: "While Golkonda has served as an important town and fortification for centuries, our dynasty needs to follow the development of our people.\n\nHyderabad has emerged as a far more important center of political power and trade, and might be a better capital city. If our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] resided there they would be far better prepared to exert their influence."
