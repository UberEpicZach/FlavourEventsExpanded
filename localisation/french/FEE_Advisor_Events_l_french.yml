 FEE_Advisor_Event.1.T: "A Pouch of Gold?"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.1.D: "$MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ beams a smile at you while handing over a pouch of gold. He claims it contains the savings accumulated from hard work and donations from the richer families in your realm."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.1.OPT1: "Excellent News!"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.2.T: "Monumental Suggestions"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.2.D: "$MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ approaches you: \"My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I have a great idea for a monument. Something to raise our cultural status and make the people notice what a great ruler you are. I would require some gold and your patience, and the work would take a year to complete.\""
 FEE_Advisor_Event.2.OPT1: "So be it! Surprise me!"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.2.OPT2: "I don't think so ..."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.3.T: "A Monumental Reveal"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.3.D: "The monument $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ promised is finished. The shape of the statue seems a bit off, as it is unveiled some of the crowd seem confused. It is a giant ear with the inscription 'IT LISTENS'."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.3.OPT1: "At least it's original."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.3.OPT2: "Tear it down!"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.4.T: "A Monumental Reveal"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.5.T: "A Monumental Reveal"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.5.D: "The monument $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ promised is finished. At the unveiling, the crowd gasps and some even scream. It's something that resembles a throne, with an eyeless horned creature on top. It smells like blood."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.5.OPT1: "I should have seen this coming."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.5.OPT2: "Climb on the throne."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.6.T: "A Monumental Reveal"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.7.T: "A Monumental Reveal"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.7.D: "The monument $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ promised is finished. The statue is unveiled and it's just a bigger version of $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$, only slightly better looking than the real $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.7.OPT1: "I don't know about this."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.7.OPT2: "Tear it down! $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ will be put in their place!"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.8.T: "A Monumental Reveal"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.8.D: "The monument $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ promised is finished. Some people in the crowd cover their children's eyes as the statue is unveiled. It's a couple in the middle of lovemaking, and not exactly presented tastefully."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.8.OPT1: "Children must learn this sooner or later."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.8.OPT2: "Tear it down!"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.9.T: "Courtly Loans"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.9.D: "A merchant approaches the court and carefully pleads to make a payment plan for the recent loan taken by $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$. It seems the fruits of labour may have been exaggerated, and since the loan was made in your name, this reflects poorly on you too. What will the consequence be for $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$?"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.9.OPT1: "Understandable, collecting taxes is tough work."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.9.OPT2: "He has overstepped his bounds."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.10.T: "A Full Days Work"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.10.D: "$MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ smiles at you. \"My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I have noticed your mind seems to drift off whenever we discuss monetary issues. I believe that to make things interesting, one must be introduced to the subject where it is directly relevant to oneself. Perhaps you would like to join me tomorrow on a full days work?\""
 FEE_Advisor_Event.10.OPT1: "Yes that would be interesting."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.10.OPT2: "Hah! You must be joking. I have better things to do."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.11.T: "A Full Days Work"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.11.D: "$MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ starts the day off collecting taxes. Some people frown and complain when they give away their earnings, $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ calmly explains why taxes are collected and manages to appease the complainers."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.11.OPT1: "Earning trust is earning gold."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.11.OPT2: "Maybe we could squeeze them for some more?"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.12.T: "A Full Days Work"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.12.D: "Today, $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ brings you to the nearest construction site to evaluate progress, notices that the builders are lagging behind the agreed schedule and proceeds to question them. The builders complain about the weather and want more pay to cover the delays, look over your way, awaiting a response."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.12.OPT1: "We will hold our end of the deal when you hold yours."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.12.OPT2: "I guess one cannot predict the weather."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.13.T: "A Full Days Work"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.13.D: "A friend has come to visit $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$ this evening. The three of you have a good time discussing your experiences over a fine evening meal. The visitor nods at you, saying to $MASTER_OF_MINT$$TREASURER$: \"How lucky you are, to have a ruler that understands your work. This cooperation should benefit both of you.\""
 FEE_Advisor_Event.13.OPT1: "It's been interesting, more so than many other things I've tried."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.13.OPT2: "It wasn't for me, it feels like stealing."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.13.OPT3: "I hated it! We should just kill the peasants and take their money."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.14.T: "Student of Language?"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.14.D: "My Advisor $STATESMAN$$DIPLOMAT$$COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$ kindly suggests that it would be of benefit to the realm if I studied the languages spoken at foreign courts. He also offers himself to aid me in my studies."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.14.OPT1: "An excellent idea!"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.14.OPT2: "If they can't speak [Root.Culture.GetName], they are not important."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.15.T: "Student of Language"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.15.D: "Distractions seem to overwhelm you during your studies. The simplest pleasures, and even plain and mundane chores, seem like time better spent than drowning in books all evening. How does one manage to keep focused when everything else is so much more appealing?"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.15.OPT1: "If I learn even a few phrases, it will be worth it!"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.15.OPT2: "I guess learning languages is not for everyone."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.16.T: "Student of Language"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.16.D: "Advisor $STATESMAN$$DIPLOMAT$$COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$ has a look of parental disappointment in his eyes, \"I believe you could have done this well if only you'd put your mind to it. Unfortunately, your disinterest is all too apparent in your absence from our meetings. With your permission, I will henceforth focus on more useful work instead of waiting for you, my Liege.\""
 FEE_Advisor_Event.16.OPT1: "You will watch your tongue or lost it!"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.17.T: "Student of Language"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.17.D.1: "Your determination and hard work have paid off. Studying with your advisor $STATESMAN$$DIPLOMAT$$COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$, you have learned several new languages to a decent level of fluency. This will surely increase your prestige at foreign courts!"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.17.D.2: "Your determination and hard work have paid off. Studying now alone, you focus hard, you have learned several new languages to a decent level of fluency. This will surely increase your prestige at foreign courts!"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.17.OPT1: "I knew I could do it!"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.18.T: "Student of Language"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.18.D: "Without the support of your advisor $STATESMAN$$DIPLOMAT$$COLONIAL_GOVERNOR$ your study sessions seem to be and far between. You increasingly feel that the challenge is just too great to tackle on your own."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.19.T: "Excessive Bureaucracy"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.19.D: "While walking down the corridor of your court, a local peasant runs up to you with panic in his eyes: \"I had come here to ask for aid since some of my sheep had been killed by wild animals, but now I just need to get out of here! I've already paid a dozen fees and been stuck in different rooms for hours in supposed 'queues' but I saw no one else there! Please help my poor soul!\""

I suggest we make use of their talents for the good of the realm.\""
 FEE_Advisor_Event.20.OPT1: "Very well."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.20.OPT2: "Our military studies are a better use of funds."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.21.T: "Untrustworthy Assistants"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.21.D: "You receive news of your Marshal's activities in [Root.Capital.GetName]. It appears he has been spreading ill words about your rule, encouraging disloyalty among the peasantry!"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.21.OPT1: "A traitor cannot be Marshal!"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.21.OPT2: "Ill tidings, but I still need him."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.22.T: "Abuse of Power"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.22.D: "Worrying reports have reached you regarding your Marshal $ARMY_REFORMER$$ARMY_ORGANISER$$COMMANDANT$$GRAND_CAPTAIN$$NAVAL_REFORMER$$QUARTERMASTER$$RECRUITMASTER$. It seems he has been using your soldiers to extort money from the peasantry in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.22.OPT1: "He has forfeited his office!"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.22.OPT2: "I will deal with this later."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.23.T: "The Brilliant Inventor"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.23.D: "Your Marshal, $ARMY_REFORMER$$ARMY_ORGANISER$$COMMANDANT$$GRAND_CAPTAIN$$NAVAL_REFORMER$$QUARTERMASTER$$RECRUITMASTER$, has put forward a plan for experimentation with new military technology, inspired by a supposedly brilliant inventor and engineer that he has recently befriended. All that is needed is a little funding..."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.23.OPT1: "You shall have it."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.23.OPT2: "No, this is pointless."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.24.T: "The Armoured Chariot"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.24.D: "You receive a report from the outcome of the military experiments that your Marshal asked you to sponsor. A large steel-plated chariot was constructed, propelled by ten men inside pulling it forward, directed by a commander peering out from a revolving turret mounted on top. This vehicle also had several ballistas firing through arrow slits. Unfortunately, its weight caused a wooden bridge to collapse when crossing and the invention was lost in the river, also killing the engineer. The marshal himself barely escaped with his life."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.24.OPT1: "Oh no!"

 FEE_Advisor_Event.25.T: "Screaming Arrows"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.25.D: "You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your Marshal asked you to sponsor. Apparently, a new kind of self-propelled arrow was tried out, based on Far Eastern models. Lit by fire, these arrows would scream and fly away leaving a trail of smoke and then explode on impact, killing several of the livestock used as practice targets. Though of dubious accuracy and prone to failure in rainy weather, these experiments have still provided some valuable lessons."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.25.OPT1: "Excellent."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.26.T: "Burning Sheep"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.26.D: "You receive a report from the outcome of the military experiments that your Marshal asked you to sponsor.

 FEE_Advisor_Event.26.OPT1: "It seems we'll be dining roast mutton..."

 FEE_Advisor_Event.27.T: "Trumpets of Doom"
 FEE_Advisor_Event.27.D: "You receive a report on the outcome of the military experiments that your Marshal asked you to sponsor. Apparently, the experiments consisted of training a large force of musicians to blow their trumpets in unison, thus deafening and stunning the enemy army in preparation for an attack. Attempts were also made to make castle walls tumble by marching around them blowing the trumpets. \n\nUnfortunately, while quite expensive, none of these experiments were successful."
 FEE_Advisor_Event.27.OPT1: "Trumpets? How much did I pay for this again?"
