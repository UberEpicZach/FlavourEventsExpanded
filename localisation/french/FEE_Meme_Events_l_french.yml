 FEE_Meme_Events.1.T: "Flavour Events Expanded Memes"
 FEE_Meme_Events.1.D: "Some events are of a lighter hearted nature and do not seriously depict real world circumstance. These events might be immersion breaking for people looking for more serious gameplay. By enabling meme events you agree that you won't come to the mods expanded discord and complain about how Bill Wurtz events aren't funny."
 FEE_Meme_Events.1.OPT1: "I love fun, I promise I won't complain about these events in an hour."
 FEE_Meme_Events.1.OPT2: "No, I take myself very seriously and have over 150000 hours in this game."

 FEE_Meme_Events.2.T: "Holding Out for a Hero"
 FEE_Meme_Events.2.D: "Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods? Where's the street-wise Hercules to fight the rising odds? Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed? Late at night I toss and I turn, I dream of what I need.\nI need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night, he's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast and he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light, he's gotta be sure and he's gotta be soon and he's gotta be larger than life."
 FEE_Meme_Events.2.OPT1: "Like the fire in my blood"
