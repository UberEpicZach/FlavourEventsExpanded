 FEE_Bohemia_Events.3.T: "Death of Jiri Podebrad"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.3.D: "Jiri Podebrad died in 1471, in the middle of his struggle with Mathias Corvinus of Hungary whonheaded a 'crusade' against Bohemia and claimed its throne. Since his supporters were in a precarious military situation, having lost all lands of the Bohemian Crown to the King of Hungary, Podebrad had shortly before his death, despite being the father of several adult sons himself, asked prince Vladislav of Poland to succeed him in order to save Hussitism and Bohemian independence, already experienced in war over in his days in Poland.. Vladislav indeed succeeded him and initiated a half-century of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia which proved to be backwards, intolerant in religious matters, devastating for Bohemia's economy and eventually resulted in the disaster of 1526. However had Podebrad been in a better situation, he might very well have used the opportunity to establish his dynasty as hereditary national Kings of Bohemia."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.3.OPT1: "Elect Vladislav Jagiello!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.3.OPT2: "Elect, Son of Jiri; Duke Victor"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.4.T: "The Bohemian Throne"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.4.D: "Jiri Podebrad died in 1471, in the middle of his struggle with Mathias Corvinus of Hungary who headed a 'crusade' against Bohemia and claimed its throne. Since his supporters were in a precarious military situation, having lost all lands of the Bohemian Crown to the King of Hungary, Podebrad had shortly before his death, despite being a father of several adult sons himself, asked prince Vladislav of Poland to succeed him in order to save Hussitism and Bohemian independence. Vladislav indeed succeeded him and initiated a half-century of Jagiellon rule in Bohemia."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.4.OPT1: "Accept the Bohemian Offer!"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.T: "Death of Matthias Corvinus"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.D: "In the last years of his reign, Matthias Corvinus tried to ensure the succession of his highly gifted, but illegitimate son Janos, made him the largest landholder in Hungary after the King by several grants of territory, put him in charge of several of the strongest and most important fortresses, gave him the holy crown of St. Stephen and got a majority of the royal council to support Janos. However Matthias Corvinus died of a stroke before the matter was definitely secured, and the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Matthias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490 and immediately thereafter accepted the compact of Farkashida in which he confirmed all existing privileges of the nobility and took back all legal and administrative reforms, including the efficient system of taxation regarded as repressive by the magnates. After 3 decades of prosperity and modernisation, the election of Vladislav initiated a rapid decline, ending up in the disaster of Mohacs. Another candidate to the throne was Maximilian of Habsburg who maintained the claim of his father Friedrich III, but since he had already proven to be a capable ruler and would have been likely to use his powerbase in the Empire, Austria and Burgundy to consolidate his authority in Hungary, he was no popular choice. Had Janos Corvinus indeed managed to become King, he might have continued the achievements of his father but would have been violently opposed by the powerful magnates."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.OPT1: "Elect Vladislav Jagiello!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.OPT2: "Janos Corvinus shall be King!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.5.OPT3: "Elect a Habsburg"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.6.T: "Wladyslaw Jagiello, King of Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.6.D: "Matthias Corvinus of Hungary died in 1490. It had been his explicit wish to let his illegitimate son Janos succeed him, however, when Corvinus was dead, the young, inexperienced Janos was soon deprived of his rights and his property by the Hungarian magnates who were fed up with the strong central rule introduced by Matthias and desired a monarch 'whose beard they could hold in their fists'. Such a candidate was found in Vladislav Jagiello, King of Bohemia since 1471. Called 'King All Right' by his Bohemian subjects because of his weakness, irresoluteness and saying yes to everything, obviously completely incompetent for ruling a Kingdom and having already initiated a rapid decline of Bohemia, he was the easily controllable puppet King the magnates were looking for. Vladislav was elected King on July 5th 1490. Like Bohemia, Hungary came thus under Polish domination. "
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.6.OPT1: "Great!"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.7.T: "Civil War in Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.7.D: "After Matthias Corvinus of Hungary's sudden death, a bitter conflict over his succession has arisen. Following his explicit wish, his illegitimate son Janos has been crowned King, however, there is considerable resistance among the magnates who are fed up with strong royal authority and high taxes. They have decided to revolt against the new King in order to protect their interest. Meanwhile, Friedrich III still bears the title King of Hungary and he and his son Maximilian are regarded by some Hungarians as the legitimate successor to the throne. Taking advantage of the conflict within it, it might be easy to press the claim and conquer Hungary now."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.7.OPT1: "Claim the Hungarian Throne!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.7.OPT2: "We have imperial issues."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.8.T: "The Kingdom of Hungary"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.8.D: "The Kingdom of Hungary has elected a new monarch, [HUN.Monarch.GetName], who lacks the support of a huge part of the nobility. There can be expected to be a long internal struggle, a pit of chaos which would probably give the Sultan an excellent opportunity to expand north."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.8.OPT1: "Chaos is not a pit, Chaos is a ladder."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.9.T: "Lessons of the Hussite Wars"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.9.D: "What was once the jewel of Central Europe was mercilessly torn apart as brother fought against brother, foreigners invaded Bohemian lands, and bitter religious struggle the like of which has never before been seen within Christian Europe came to our kingdom.\n\nHowever, there was some benefit to the extreme violence which engulfed our nation. Many of the most talented and educated Bohemians flocked to the Hussite cause, and their ingenuity allowed them to craft new weapons and fight against overwhelming odds.\n\nIn fact, many of the new weapons and tactics used would later grow to define early modern European warfare. The infamous Hussite wagon fort would be adopted by German, Hungarian, Russian, and even British armies. The Hussite armies also pioneered artillery pieces such as the howitzer and the houfnice, as well as new and more deadly hand cannons which served as thebasis for early modern pistols."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.9.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.10.T: "A Message of Peace"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.10.D: "Despite being condemned as a heretic by the Pope after a forcible seizure of power, Jiri Podebrad never ceased to reconcile with not only the Pope, but the hostile neighboring Catholicrulers of Austria, Hungary, and Poland.\n\nPerhaps ahead of his time, Podebrad proposed a 'Charter of a Universal Peace Union,' in which all Christian nations, starting with the member states of the Holy Roman Empire, would pledge to resolve all disputes peacefully, respect one anothers' national sovereignty, and create a common parliament and court, in which all members would get one vote, with the King of France having two. Additionally, he dreamed of uniting Christian nations against the rising threat of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOne proponent of Podebrad's plan was a prominent nobleman who proved himself an able diplomat, representing Bohemia in the courts of Austria and Hungary. His work, while unsuccessful in establishing Podebrad's dream, did go a long way towards smoothing over the rift between Bohemia and her neighbors. \n\nPodebrad's Hussite beliefs prevented his ideas from being seriously considered, especially as the Pope, whose power was threatened by this Union, worked against him. However, his message of peace planted a seed in European politics that would never be wholly forgotten."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.10.OPT1: "Unfortunate, but we can make some good out of this."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.10.OPT2: "How naïve! Perhaps we should forget the whole thing."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.11.T: "Thaler Coinage"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.11.D: "Shortly after a rich deposit of silver was found in Joachimsthal, the Crown of Bohemia gave control of the mines to the wealthiest noble family in Bohemia, the Counts von Schlick. They began minting a new large silver coin, giving the name of the town to the new coin - the Thaler. This would go on to become the first truly standardized coinage across the Holy Roman Empire, and would become the ancestor of the British silver crown, the Dutch rijksdaalder, and even the US dollar.\n\nThis large, reliable coin filled the void as a reliable standard of exchange between the regions of Europe, especially in the prosperous but divided principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, where the coin received Imperial approval."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.11.OPT1: "Wonderful news!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.11.OPT2: "Yes yes, very nice, but what's in it for me?"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.12.T: "The Defenestration of Prague"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.12.D: "If recent history has taught us one thing, it is that the Bohemian people are not to be trifled with in matters of religion and maintaining of their treasured religious unity.\n\nThis lesson seems to have been lost on those who would be our overlords. A delegation has arrived in Prague, demanding that we tear up our Letter of Majesty which guarantees religious tolerance and enforce Catholicism on our populace."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.12.OPT1: "Throw them out the window!"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.12.OPT2: "We have no choice but to submit."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.13.T: "Sack of Prague"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.13.D: "Disaster has befallen us! Prague, once one of the great cultural and economic centers, has fallen to the invading enemy! We can only curse the foolishness of our rulers who, scorning the example of past rulers, sought peace with enemies on the field rather than through a siege of their capital city. A full quarter of the city has been levelled and even the great cathedral has suffered damage."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.13.OPT1: "Will we ever recover?"

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.14.T: "The Peasant King Jakub"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.14.D: "In 1445, a tall peasant with greying hair, dressed in a poor regal robe, appeared in Stadice. He settled in the middle of the village green and began to tell passers-by that he was the peasant king Jakub and he was of the Přemyslid dynasty. He is said to be sent by Wenceslas I to restore order in the kingdom. He had a natural authority and spoke of Bohemia's future so eloquently that thousands of people came to listen to his words. Later he established a council of four elders and a scribe who published his manifestos and letters.\n\nWhen the nobility learned of him, they sent guards to arrest him. Jakub went without resistance as he wished for them to take him to Prague. They granted his wish and took him and a handful of his closest relatives to Prague. There he was received by the burgomasters and revealed that he was the chosen one who would become the new king."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.14.OPT1: "He is the chosen one."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.14.OPT2: "He is just a harmless old fool. Send him back with some money."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.15.T: "The Second Defenestration of Prague"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.15.D: "In 1480, several townspeople and 4 Hussite priests were arrested and tortured, resulting in one of the priests dying. The tension between Hussites and Catholics came to a head in 1483. Radical Hussites used alleged information that Catholics would disrupt the Hussite festival as a pretext for a coup d'état. One morning, the radical Hussites invaded the Old Town Hall and threw the burgomaster from a window, while at the New Town Hall, they killed several councillors and threw them from windows. They imprisoned the remaining councillors who confessed that they planned to kill several Hussites and expel Hussite priests from Prague."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.15.OPT1: "God be with us, the light is between us, and our faithful are without underwear."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.16.T: "Religious Peace of Kutná Hora"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.16.D: "After the Second Defenestration of Prague, the religious situation was slowly developing towards religious reconciliation. The Religious Peace of Kutná Hora concluded two years after the defenestration at the Czech lands Diet in Kutná Hora between Hussites and Catholics. They declared the Council of Basel as the base law of the land. Finally, Hussites and Catholics were equal in the eyes of the law, thus achieving religious peace."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.16.OPT1: "The definitive end of the Hussite Wars."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.17.T: "Olomoucká Univerzita"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.17.D: "Olomouc had a long history in education before the Jesuit College was elevated to a university. In 1249, the Bishop of Olomouc, Bruno ze Šamberka, established a school. In 1566, the Bishop of Olomouc Vilém Prusinovský invited the Jesuits to establish a college as he planned to recatholize Moravia. Vilém was following the policy of the Council of Trent and forcing Hussites to accept his authority, but he died in 1572. In 1573 Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II elevated the college to a university, thus becoming the second university in the Kingdom of Bohemia."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.17.OPT1: "This is one of many steps in reforming the Kingdom."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.17.OPT2: "We should not provoke the Hussites and others."

 FEE_Bohemia_Events.18.T: "The Royal Capital of Prague"
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.18.D: "Since earlier times, several monarchs have tried to unify the city of Prague. However, they were either unsuccessful or the unification only lasted for a short time. The burgomasters and councillors of the separate cities (Old Town of Prague, Malá Strana, Hradčany, and the New Town of Prague) carefully protected their privileges and independence. Now, the situation is an anachronism hindering the development of the city. Recently, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been passing several reforms, one of them being the unification of Prague. If unified, Prague will become a more important political, cultural, economic, and social centre in Bohemia."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.18.OPT1: "Prague has been united."
 FEE_Bohemia_Events.18.OPT2: "Perhaps for the right price, they can keep their independence."
