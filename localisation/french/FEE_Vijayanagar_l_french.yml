 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.1.T: "Deva Raya II, a Patron of Literature"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.1.D: "While being best known for his military prowess and success in establishing ties with the Reddy Nayaks, Devaraya Sangama's military merit has largely been brushed over. With a title meaning 'killer of elephants', it's no surprise that he's brought our empire to a new zenith. Despite his title and reputation, he is most notable for his extensive patronage of literature and the arts. Within his court, many famous poets the likes of Kumara Vyasa or Narayanappan and Chamarasa flourished, and many new great Kannada works were authored. The legendary epic of the Mahabharata was translated into Kannada, and Devaraya himself wrote many Sanskrit and Kannada texts. Even scholars and Telugu poets also called this Raja's court home."

 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.2.T: "Vaishnava and Veerashaiva"
 FEE_Vijayanagar_Events.2.D: "In the vibrant literary tapestry of the mid-15th century at the illustrious court of the Karnataka Samrajya, two remarkable authors, Chamarasa and Kumara Vyasa, emerged as luminaries, contributing significantly to Kannada literature. Chamarasa, a staunch advocate of the Veerashaiva faith, penned the celebrated "Prabhulinga Leele" in 1430 AD, portraying Allama Prabhu as an early apostle of Veerashaivism. His work, rich in Yogic and vairagya themes, intertwines the journey of Allama Prabhu with allegorical elements, offering a unique perspective on faith. \nKumara Vyasa, on the other hand, showcased his literary prowess with "Gadugina Bharata," an adaptation of the first ten parvas of the Mahabharata. A devotee of Krishna, Kumara Vyasa's magnum opus explores diverse human emotions, values, and intricate metaphors, setting a benchmark in Kannada literature. Both authors flourished under the patronage of King Deva Raya II, who played a pivotal role in promoting the cultural and literary landscape of the Vijayanagar court. \nChamarasa and Kumara Vyasa's works not only reflected the cultural ethos of the Karnataka Samrajya but also resonated beyond its borders. King Deva Raya II's support allowed these literary luminaries to delve into profound themes, contributing to the rich literary heritage of the Kannada language."

This artistically sophisticated Hindu temple in Hampi forms an integral part of the sacred center of Vijayanagara. Dedicated to Vitthala, a form of Krishna also known as Vithoba, the temple faces east and is designed with a square plan featuring an imposing entrance gopuram flanked by two side gopurams. At the heart of a paved courtyard stands the main temple, surrounded by several subsidiary shrines, all oriented to the east. Encompassing a courtyard measuring 500 by 300 feet, the temple is encircled by a triple row of pillars, standing at an average height of 25 feet. The temple is divided into three distinct compartments: a garbhagriha, an ardhamandapa, and a mahamandapa. \nA prominent feature of the Vitthala temple is the Garuda shrine, crafted in the form of a stone chariot situated within the courtyard; this chariot has become an iconic symbol of Hampi. Atop the chariot rises a tower, and in front of it stands a large, open-pillared axial sabha mandapa, or community hall. This mandapa comprises four sections, two of which align with the temple sanctum. The hall boasts 56 intricately carved stone beams of varying diameters, shapes, lengths, and surface finishes that produce musical sounds when struck; local tradition holds that this hall was used for public celebrations of music and dance. It is classified as a Karakkoil, a temple styled after the temple chariots paraded during festivals. \nThe mandapa connects to an enclosed pradakshina patha, designed for circumambulation around the sanctum. Surrounding this axial mandapa are the Garuda shrine, the Kalyana mandapa, the 100-columned mandapa, the Amman shrine, and the Utsav mandapa. The walled enclosure spans about 1.3 hectares, with colonnaded verandahs lining the compound walls. In the southeast corner, one finds a kitchen with a roof window. \nBeyond the temple compound, to its east-southeast, lies a colonnaded market street nearly one kilometer long, now in ruins. To the north is another market and a south-facing shrine adorned with reliefs depicting scenes from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the lives of Vaishnava saints. The northern street culminates in a temple dedicated to the Hindu philosopher Ramanuja. The area around the Vitthala temple, known as Vitthalapura, was a vibrant center for Vaishnavite worship, housing a Vaishnava matha that served as a pilgrimage site centered around the Alvar tradition.

In the midst of the market to the north of this road lies a large Pushkarani, a public utility stepped water tank with an artistic pavilion at its center. Adjacent to the tank is a mandapa for people to sit and gather. \nThe temple opens to the east and boasts a gateway adorned with reliefs depicting all ten avatars of Vishnu, starting with Matsya at the bottom. Within the temple complex lie the ruins of the main Krishna temple and smaller, ruined shrines dedicated to goddesses. The temple compound is structured with multiple mandapas, including an outer and an inner enclosure, and features two gopuram entrances. Inside, a 25-bay open mandapa leads to a 9-bay enclosed mandapa. The western gopuram is decorated with friezes depicting battle formations and soldiers. \nTo the south of the Krishna temple's exterior stand two adjacent shrines, one housing the largest monolithic Shiva Linga and the other enshrining the largest monolithic Yoga-Narasimha avatar of Vishnu in Hampi. The 3-meter Shiva Linga stands in water within a cubical chamber and is marked with three eyes on its top.

The temple is approached from the river, passing first a ceremonial tank and then along a broad market street. The temple complex features an outer gopuram that leads into a courtyard with a 100-column hall, and an inner gopuram that provides entry to the Vishnu temple. Each pillar in the 100-column hall is adorned with reliefs depicting Vishnu's avatars, other deities such as Shiva, Surya, and Durga, scenes of daily life including rishis, amorous couples, jesters, people performing yoga asanas, people in namaste poses, and Vijayanagara emblems. \nThe temple gateway prominently displays the emblems of the Vijayanagara dynasty: a boar symbolizing Varaha, a sword, the sun, and the moon."
