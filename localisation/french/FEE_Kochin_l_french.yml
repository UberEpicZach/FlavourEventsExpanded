 FEE_Kochin_Events.1.T: "New Arrivals, New Opportunities?"
 FEE_Kochin_Events.1.D: "As the Europeans made their presence felt in our southern rival's territory, we watched with keen interest. The economic changes they brought about signalled a need for swift action if we were to seize any advantage. The arrival of the Portuguese in Calicut had opened our eyes to the potential benefits and threats posed by these foreign traders. Determined not to be left behind, we extended an invitation to those very Portuguese who had visited Calicut. Our envoys presented a compelling case, highlighting the advantages of aligning with us. The Portuguese, intrigued by the prospect, accepted our invitation and arrived at our court with high expectations. Through shrewd negotiations, we managed to secure a deal even better than what Calicut had obtained. Instead of merely establishing a trade agreement, we struck a production deal that favoured our interests. The Portuguese were granted permission to build one of their factories within our territory, but with conditions that ensured our control over the entire process. We provided the raw materials needed for production, and in return, the Portuguese would process these materials into refined goods suitable for trade back in Europe. However, we insisted that they hire our skilled artisans to do the work, maintaining control over both the trade of the goods and their production. This arrangement allowed us to benefit from the expertise and technology of the Portuguese without the obligation of sharing our own artisanal secrets. The factory became a bustling centre of activity, where our artisans worked diligently, transforming raw goods into valuable commodities. The Portuguese, satisfied with the quality and efficiency of our workforce, saw their profits grow. Meanwhile, we retained our sovereignty over the trade and production processes, ensuring that our economic interests were safeguarded. Through this strategic alliance, we not only gained an economic edge over our southern rival but also positioned ourselves as key players in the burgeoning global trade network. The arrival of the Europeans, once a potential threat, had been turned into an opportunity that strengthened our kingdom and secured our place in the ever-changing world."
