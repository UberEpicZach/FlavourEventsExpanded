The Margraviates of Ansbach and Bayreuth have long since enjoyed independence, away from our crown's influence. In order to secure our vested interests in the area and protect its people from foreign invasions, we should secure and press our legitimate claims on the surrounding areas with any means necessary, starting with the city of Nuremberg.

Thanks to a marriage to a Hohenzollern princess in 1374, our blood has flowed in the veins of the von Wettin dynasty of Thuringia for generations.
