However, by the late 15th century, the monasteries had ended up in debt to the Sultan, and they now stood to lose the land they were built on. \nStephen III, however, drew from his personal coffers to pay off their loan, so that the Greek monasteries would not be lost."

Once in power he turned out to be a brilliant financer, and became one of the richest men in Eastern Europe. His wealth sustained gifts to the Ottoman sultan, which placated Moldavia's overlord and kept the country in good standing. \nVasile Lupu was a builder and a patron of the arts, but at the cost of unbearable taxation on the peasantry. Eventually he would come into conflict with the prince of Wallachia, who after long wars replace him with one of his own nobles. Lupu died in a prison in Constantinople in 1661, eight years after being deposed."
