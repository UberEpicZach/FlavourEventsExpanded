 hee_HSA.1.t:0 "Hamburg Invites the English"
 hee_HSA.1.d:0 "In order to pay off huge debts built up over the course of the Schmalkaldic War, Hamburg invited English traders to settle in the city. This was in direct violation of the rules of the Hanseatic League, but due to the decline of the League’s strength, and the fact that it actually helped pay off Hamburg’s debt meant that no action was taken against the city."
 hee_HSA.1.a:0 "The city needs this."
 hee_HSA.1.b:0 "No foreign traders are allowed to settle in any Hansa land, and we will keep it that way!"
 hee_HSA.2.t:0 "The Hanseatic Legion and the Hamburg Citizen Militia"
 hee_HSA.2.d:0 "In 1813, during the War of the Sixth Coalition, the Hanseatic Legion was formed by a group of citizens from Hamburg, to fight against the invading forces of France. From there they went on to join the coalition forces in fighting across northern Germany. The following year, the Hamburg Citizen Militia formed to eject French garrisons from the remaining Hanseatic cities of Hamburg, Lubeck and Bremen. The Hanseatic Legion was dissolved in 1814, and all its returning members received military honours from the city. The Hamburg Citizen Militia would go on to continue as military guard in the now independent country of Hamburg until 1868."
