 FEE_Gelre_Events.1.T: "The Revolt of Adolf van Egmond"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.1.D: "In 1465, the first Egmond duke of Gelre, Alfred, suffered a rebellion from his son, Adolf. Adolf was supported by not only the fourmajor cities of Gelre, but also by the Duke of Burgundy.\n\nArnold was imprisoned, and his son seized power. His favour was short-lived, however, and the continued struggle for power would culminate in the sale of the right of succession in Gelre to the Dukes of Burgundy."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.1.OPT1: "We will destroy Adolf's revolt!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.1.OPT2: "Let's ensure the Duke of Burgundy supports our side."

 FEE_Gelre_Events.2.T: "Burgundy Demands a Compromise!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.2.D: "Following the turmoil in our country, our powerful neighbour the Duke of Burgundy has demanded that our power struggles cease bringing instability to the region.\n\nThings can certainly not continue as they have, but only one solution has been found to ensure the continued prosperity of our little duchy. The Duke of Burgundy might be willing to pay a significant amount of gold to receive the right of inheritance of $COUNTRY$. This would ensure that the nobles fighting over the right to rule would be bypassed. Although we would swear fealty under a foreign ruler, we would also be able to line our coffers quite handsomely."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.2.OPT1: "Offer the ruler of Burgundy the right to rule."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.2.OPT2: "We can sort these troubles ourselves!"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.3.T: "The Compromise of Gelre"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.3.D: "Following recent instabilities in their country, and the worry that a power struggle will spread across their borders, our diplomats have presented to the Gelreans an irresistible offer.\n\n To avoid further infighting, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Burgundy may buy the right to succession in Gelre, thus bypassing the fighting parties. This would require us to dig deep in our coffers, but would expand our influence in the Low Countries."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.3.OPT1: "We will do everything in our power to solve the crisis of Gelre."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.3.OPT2: "Let us only offer them diplomatic support, not protection."

 FEE_Gelre_Events.4.T: "Burgundy Accepts the Compromise"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.4.D: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of Burgundy has accepted our offer of a political solution! They will now protect ourlands, and we now have an enormous ducal grant to develop our duchy."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.4.OPT1: "Sweet, sweet gold!"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.5.T: "Burgundy Refuses the Compromise!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.5.D: "Blaming a lack of funds, Burgundy has offended us with a move of diplomatic betrayal. They have refused our offer of union!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.5.OPT1: "We should stop fighting among ourselves and look to our enemies on the outside..."

 FEE_Gelre_Events.6.T: "Claims to the Duchy of Gelre "
 FEE_Gelre_Events.6.D: "While Gelre has only recently become independent of Julich under personal union, the Duke of Gelre, Arnold van Egmond, is a man of great ambition. He seeks to become a strong Duke in his own right, competing with the influence of the Duke of Burgundy and the Habsburgs. \nHowever, Arnold's reign in Gelre itself is far from stable. His equally ambitious son, Adolf, while young, may yet try to have him removed, and the nobles and burghers of Gelre are hardly friendly to Arnold's ambitions either. \nGelre bring relatively poor among the Lowland realms means that an influx of cash may very well stabilize the situation and give the Duke of Gelre the boost he needs to project dominance over the surrounding princes. The Duke of Burgundy might be able to oblige... in return for certain concessions."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.6.OPT1: "Make the offer"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.6.OPT2: "We don't need the help of Burgundian"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.7.T: "Gelre Requests Financial Aid"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.7.D: "An emissary from the Duke of Guelders has arrived at our court requesting an audience. He claims that the Duke desires a loan from our Duke, which he would use to fight the other princes in the Lowlands. Naturally this would help us by distracting potential enemies. However, our advisors are concerned that Duke Arnold may simply renege on the loan. In response, the Gelderland diplomat says that the Duke is willing to offer just about anything as collateral for a generous loan."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.7.OPT1: "Only the title of Duke of Guelders is worth such a price. Take it or leave it"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.8.T: "Burgundy's Proposal"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.8.D: "In exchange for his loan, the Duke of Burgundy has demanded that Duke Arnold hand over his title as Duke as collateral for the loan, meaning that, if he doesn't pay it back, the Duke of Burgundy may add yet another title to his already substantial list. \nNaturally, when the nobility and burghers of the realm heard of this deal they were outraged. They demand that this deal be rejected to preserve Gelre's sovereignty."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.8.OPT1: "Just give me the money!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.8.OPT2: "The Burgundians ask for too much! No deal!"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.9.T: "The Bill Comes Due"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.9.D: "The Duke is dead! Even as his body was laid to rest, representatives of the ever-meddlesome Burgundians have arrived, demanding repayment in full of their loan, and threatening to seize the Duchy if we don't. Our people never supported the making of the deal in the first place, and they certainly will not brook such a financially burdensome repayment. However, the prospect of subjugation under Burgundy is not an option likely to receive much favor either."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.9.OPT1: "A contract is a contract. We must pay."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.9.OPT2: "If they want the Duchy, they'll have to come and take it"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.10.T: "The Guelders Wars"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.10.D: "Disputes over titles between the Duke of Guelders and his neighbors have resulted in on and off conflict with Gelre for decades. However, given limited resources, no decisive military engagement has been fought, the war being largely fought as a series of border raids and skirmishes. \nIn addition to defending his own title, the Duke aspires to build a strong nation-state in his own right in the Lowlands, competing with Burgundian and Imperial influence. His reputation for not paying back loans led to a shortage of funds for this ambitious project. Gelre, therefore, opted to allow its troops free rein to pillage and plunder in place of regular pay. Needless to say, this has resulted in increased suffering for those on the front lines, and promises great destruction, should one of the major Lowlands cities fall to them..."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.10.OPT1: "So be it"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.11.T: "Sack of Hague"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.11.D: "The long and bloody Guelders Wars have finally moved out of the inland interior of the Lowlands and have struck the prosperous coast of Holland itself! \nThe now-legendary looting prowess of Gelderland troops was unleashed on the historic capital of Holland, The Hague. The looting continued for days until order was finally restored."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.11.OPT1: "Sounds good to me!"

 FEE_Gelre_Events.12.T: "Duke of Guelders Dies"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.12.D: "When the last Duke of Guelders with a strong claim died without an heir, he had done everything in his power to ensure that his prized Duchy went to anyone other than the Emperor, who had a legal claim on it based on the Burgundian claim established all those years ago. \nThe closest living relative lay in the Duke of Berg, the nation which have subjugated Gelre and from which Gelre had broken off in 1438."
 FEE_Gelre_Events.12.OPT1: "We shall remain independent!"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.12.OPT2: "We must recognize the rightful authority of the Emperor"
 FEE_Gelre_Events.12.OPT3: "We have fought for nothing for long enough. Let us go back to the Bergians"
