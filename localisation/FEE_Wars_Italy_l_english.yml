 FEE_Wars_Italy_Events.100.T: "Guerra del Gesso"
 FEE_Wars_Italy_Events.100.D: "The little more than twenty year old King of France [FRA.Monarch.GetName], through his paternal grandmother, Maria of Anjou (1404-1463), claimed a distant hereditary right to the crown of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1492 he directed the resources of his kingdom towards the conquest of that realm, encouraged by Ludovico Sforza, called Il Moro (who was not yet Duke of Milan but was only its regent) and urged by his advisors, Guillaume Briçonnet and de Vers. \nThe reconquest of the largest kingdom of the Peninsula, already ruled by the House of Anjou (from 1282 to 1442), did not include, in the projects of Charles, Sicily. Through the conquest of the kingdom of Naples the king of France could have not simply increased the dominions of his House, an ambition common to many Middle-European or Anglo-Saxon ruling houses, but rather to make them the starting point for those Crusades whose echo had been reinvigorated by the expulsion of the Arabs from the last Spanish possession, the Kingdom of Granada (1492). The political project of Res Publica Christiana Pro Recuperanda Terra Sancta still had a hold in the European aristocracies, despite the fact that the eight Crusades aimed at realizing it ended in disaster. The King of France himself, Louis IX, lost his life during the Eighth Crusade. Acre, the last Christian stronghold, fell definitively in 1291."

 FEE_Wars_Italy_Events.200.D: "It's 1498, after the death of Charles VIII his cousin [FRA.Monarch.GetName] duke of Orleans has risen to the throne, after the Guerra del Gesso, the first Italian War, has spread bllod all over Italy with the French claim on the Napolitan throne Italy is still in turmoil and the Dukedom of Milan, home of our grandmother Valentina Visconti is now vacant and it could be once claimed for eternity. We have already tried to claim the city of Milan during the first campaign of cousin Charles VIII when we occupied Novara from Ludovico Sforza, but sadly back then we failed due to the intervetion of the Holy League lead by Venetian and Milanese forces. Now due to the strenght of the Venetian and the isolation of the Milanese throne we might be able to reclaim our place in the Italian affairs."
