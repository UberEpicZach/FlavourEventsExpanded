 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.1.T: "The States General"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.1.D: "While we have brought stable and loyal governance to the rich trade lands of the Low Countries, these provinces have long held a fierce traditions of local rights and privileges. At the same time, with the decline of the Hanseatic League, the merchants of the Low Countries are amassing ever more wealth and influence with which to back up their demands. \nThese bourgeoisie, along with prominent nobility and bishops of our subjects, have gathered to request a general meeting of delegations from all our subject states, called the States General."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.1.OPT1: "Convene the States General!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.1.OPT2: "These shopkeepers need to stick to their trades and stay out of politics"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.2.T: "Baltic Grain"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.2.D: "Situated perfectly at the confluence of the Baltic Sea, English Channel, and Rhine River trade routes, Amsterdam grew in importance and influence throughout the 15th century. As the Hanseatic League to the east began to lose coherence, merchants from Amsterdam increasingly filled the vacuum in the Baltic Sea. The growing population of the Lowlands also led to an increased demand for grain from the Baltic shores, since land could no longer be reclaimed fast enough to keep up with demand for food. \nThe upshot of all this was that Amsterdam would become the primary port in Europe for the important and distribution of grain from the Baltic."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.2.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.3.T: "The Frisian Peasant Rebellion"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.3.D: "The area of Frisian has long been known for its “Frisian Freedom,” the near-complete absence of feudalism and serfdom that was known almost nowhere else in the world during the Middle Ages. However, external forces gradually eroded the Frisian Freedom through military efforts or even outright buying off of local power brokers. By 1498, the Freedom was all but gone, and Imperial forces would occupy Frisia. \nIt wouldn’t take long before this occupation and revocation of ancient freedoms, stemming from the time of Charlemagne himself, would be rejected by the population. Things came to a head when the Black Band, a mercenary company stationed to maintain order, extracted “payment” by looting local villages."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.3.OPT1: "How dare they?"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.3.OPT2: "Give them their freedom, we have more important concerns now"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.4.T: "Claims to the Duchy of Gelre "
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.4.D: "While Gelre has only recently become independent of Julich under personal union, the Duke of Gelre, Arnold van Egmond, is a man of great ambition. He seeks to become a strong Duke in his own right, competing with the influence of the Duke of Burgundy and the Habsburgs. \nHowever, Arnold’s reign in Gelre itself is far from stable. His equally ambitious son, Adolf, while young, may yet try to have him removed, and the nobles and burghers of Gelre are hardly friendly to Arnold’s ambitions either. \nGelre bring relatively poor among the Lowland realms means that an influx of cash may very well stabilize the situation and give the Duke of Gelre the boost he needs to project dominance over the surrounding princes. The Duke of Burgundy might be able to oblige... in return for certain concessions."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.4.OPT1: "Make the offer"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.4.OPT2: "We don’t need the help of Burgundian"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.5.T: "Gelre Requests Financial Aid"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.5.D: "An emissary from the Duke of Guelders has arrived at our court requesting an audience. He claims that the Duke desires a loan from our Duke, which he would use to fight the other princes in the Lowlands. Naturally this would help us by distracting potential enemies. However, our advisors are concerned that Duke Arnold may simply renege on the loan. In response, the Gelderland diplomat says that the Duke is willing to offer just about anything as collateral for a generous loan."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.5.OPT1: "Only the title of Duke of Guelders is worth such a price. Take it or leave it"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.6.T: "Burgundy’s Proposal"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.6.D: "In exchange for his loan, the Duke of Burgundy has demanded that Duke Arnold hand over his title as Duke as collateral for the loan, meaning that, if he doesn’t pay it back, the Duke of Burgundy may add yet another title to his already substantial list. \nNaturally, when the nobility and burghers of the realm heard of this deal they were outraged. They demand that this deal be rejected to preserve Gelre’s sovereignty."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.6.OPT1: "Just give me the money!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.6.OPT2: "The Burgundians ask for too much! No deal!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.7.T: "The Bill Comes Due"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.7.D: "The Duke is dead! Even as his body was laid to rest, representatives of the ever-meddlesome Burgundians have arrived, demanding repayment in full of their loan, and threatening to seize the Duchy if we don’t. Our people never supported the making of the deal in the first place, and they certainly will not brook such a financially burdensome repayment. However, the prospect of subjugation under Burgundy is not an option likely to receive much favor either."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.7.OPT1: "A contract is a contract. We must pay."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.7.OPT2: "If they want the Duchy, they’ll have to come and take it"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.8.T: "The Guelders Wars"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.8.D: "Disputes over titles between the Duke of Guelders and his neighbors have resulted in on and off conflict with Gelre for decades. However, given limited resources, no decisive military engagement has been fought, the war being largely fought as a series of border raids and skirmishes. \nIn addition to defending his own title, the Duke aspires to build a strong nation-state in his own right in the Lowlands, competing with Burgundian and Imperial influence. His reputation for not paying back loans led to a shortage of funds for this ambitious project. Gelre, therefore, opted to allow its troops free rein to pillage and plunder in place of regular pay. Needless to say, this has resulted in increased suffering for those on the front lines, and promises great destruction, should one of the major Lowlands cities fall to them..."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.8.OPT1: "So be it"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.9.T: "Sack of Hague"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.9.D: "The long and bloody Guelders Wars have finally moved out of the inland interior of the Lowlands and have struck the prosperous coast of Holland itself! \nThe now-legendary looting prowess of Gelderland troops was unleashed on the historic capital of Holland, The Hague. The looting continued for days until order was finally restored."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.9.OPT1: "Sounds good to me!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.10.T: "Duke of Guelders Dies"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.10.D: "When the last Duke of Guelders with a strong claim died without an heir, he had done everything in his power to ensure that his prized Duchy went to anyone other than the Emperor, who had a legal claim on it based on the Burgundian claim established all those years ago. \nThe closest living relative lay in the Duke of Berg, the nation which have subjugated Gelre and from which Gelre had broken off in 1438."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.10.OPT1: "We shall remain independent!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.10.OPT2: "We must recognize the rightful authority of the Emperor"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.10.OPT3: "We have fought for nothing for long enough. Let us go back to the Bergians"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.11.T: "The Supreme Court of Holland"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.11.D: "While Den Haag has long served as the administrative center of the Hollanders, the steady increase of the region in population, wealth, and influence has required ever more legal protections and effective administration of justice, a need which has outgrown our institutions’ ability to provide it. Especially important for an area so dependent on trade is the consistent and meaningful enforcement of contracts and the protection of property rights. These are two cornerstones of any successful economy. \nTo that end, it has been proposed that a new standardized court system be set up, one that not only is independent over legal matters in our lands, but also regulates commerce on the high seas going through our ports. \nThe flagship of this new court system would be in the Hague, the better to maintain independence from the merchant interests in fast-growing Amsterdam or the nobility interests further inland. "
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.11.OPT1: "Let the Hague be an example to the rest of the world!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.12.T: "The Corneliszoon Sawmill"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.12.D: "While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the sawmill was invented in Holland, since sawmills have existed since Roman times, Cornelis Corneliszoon was the first to craft a round saw blade that was attached via a pitman arm onto a windmill. This vastly increased the speed and efficiency at which a sawmill operated, and allowed for a rapid expansion of Dutch maritime capability."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.12.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.13.T: "Defensive Reforms"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.13.D: "Since the Middle Ages, the Dutch have been unique in the world for their ability to build great dikes, walls to keep out the sea itself. More recently, wars of independence and the strategic vulnerability of our lands have trained us in the arts of building state-of-the-art forts on our frontiers. The invention of the bastion is just the latest in the European-wide arms race between defense and offense. We must be prepared to keep up to maintain our edge."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.13.OPT1: "Spare no expenses in investing for our defense"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.13.OPT2: "Our brave soldiers, not stone walls, are how we must defend ourselves"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.14.T: "Michiel de Ruyter"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.14.D: "While Michiel de Ruyter has already had a full and illustrious career, serving everything from a musket under Maurice of Nassau to a pirate-hunter aboard privately-owned ships, his latest assignment has brought him fully to our attention. \nWhile assigned as captain of a state-owned man-of-war hunting Portuguese raiders, he distinguished himself in combat against a combined Spanish and Portuguese fleet. \nThere, despite an cautious nature on land, he showed exemplary boldness and steadfastness in the face of dangerous undertakings. He would go down in history as one of the most skilled naval leaders in Dutch history."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.14.OPT1: "He shall be made an admiral!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.14.OPT2: "His advice is essential for the state!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.15.T: "A Daring Attack"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.15.D: "However regrettable the circumstances may or may not be, we find ourselves at war with the English over the question of naval supremacy. However, word has been leaked that the English have been forced to lay in their fleet for repairs due to budget concerns. \nTo most navies, this would put them safely out of reach for repairs. But we will not be so easily discouraged. One of our leading politicians, working in conjunction with one of our best admirals, has devised a bold operation the likes of which has never been attempted against the English navy. He proposes to sail our navy into the mouth of the Thames itself, engage the fortifications there directly and attack the English fleet while it is unable to move or defend itself."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.15.OPT1: "Fortune favors the bold!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.16.T: "Raid on the Medway"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.16.D: "Utter disaster has befallen our glorious fleet! Despite ample warning by our spies in Holland, the Naval Board completely discounted the idea that the Dutch would dare launch an attack into the Thames itself. Imagine our shock, then, when a morning fog lifted to reveal the horrible sight of the entire Dutch navy bearing down on the Thames! \nhe Dutch broke through out defensive chains and burned many of our finest ships, even capturing the flagship itself! Many prominent voices begin to fear that a defeat of this scale might prove the undoing of the whole kingdom. The city of London has flown into a panic of the now-dreaded Dutch! And well they might, for this will go down in history as the worst defeat ever suffered by the Royal Navy, and one of the worst in all our military history!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.16.OPT1: "Horrors!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.17.T: "Raid on the Medway"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.17.D: "Totally unprepared for our bold move, we have inflicted nothing short of catastrophe on the enemy navy! We even managed to unmoor two of the best ships and take them back to Amsterdam for ourselves. \nThis great victory has reinvigorated the people in this war, and will doubtless lead to a more favorable peace deal as well as go down in history. Celebrations of this victory continued through the night throughout the nation"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.17.OPT1: "Glorious!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.18.T: "Dutch Settlers at the Cape"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.18.D: "nitially, the only Dutch presence at the Cape of Good Hope was a VOC supply post for ships on the way to the Indies. It was never thought that it would become a destination for Dutch settlers; indeed, for much of the history of the Republic we have been a destination for immigrants rather than a source of emigration. \nLately, however, rumors of rich farmland and a labor shortage in the VOC has encourage a rare outpouring of Dutch migration there. Dutch Calvinists, mostly farmers from the interior Netherlands where trade wealth wasn’t as abundant as on the coast, were the majority of the immigrants, but they were quickly followed by Germans and French Huguenots as well. Soon, the immigrants even ventured out beyond the Cape, which itself was becoming a developed city in its own right. \nDespite this influx, the VOC has been reticent to invest any more into the well-being of the colony, treating it as little more than a glorified campsite."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.18.OPT1: "Encourage the settlers of Cape Town!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.18.OPT2: "Encourage the settlement of the hinterlands!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.18.OPT3: "This is a matter for the VOC alone"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.19.T: "The Grand Alliance"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.19.D: "It has been a geopolitical constant of Europe that France, with its huge population, fertile soil, and absolutist rule has been the most powerful nation in Western Europe, if not all of the European continent. \nWith the weakening of the Holy Roman Emperor, long the counterweight to French ambitious, by religious wars, and even rumors of a Franco-Ottoman alliance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided that it is high time the powers of western Europe formalize their intention to contain France. Accordingly, all nations with an interest in doing so shall receive invitations to meet in the Hague and form a Grand Alliance against the French."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.19.OPT1: "Let the Treaty be signed!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.19.OPT2: "On second thought, we can handle this ourselves"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.20.T: "Rembrandt"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.20.D: "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, commonly known simply as Rembrandt, was a Dutch painter, printmaker, and draughtsman from Leiden. An innovator in all three distinct art media, he is widely considered one of the greatest artists in history and single-handedly embodied the Dutch Golden Age of the arts. He became famous for his intimate and brooding self-portraits, prints of scenes from the Bible, and his pioneering work in the technique of etching. \nIn opposition to the prevailing Baroque style of the age, and to the art styles which preceded them, Rembrandt’s paintings, like those of other Dutch masters, presented ordinary life scenes as objects of high art. This “democratization” of art showed such empathy for ordinary human life that he was called “one of the great prophets of civilization."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.20.OPT1: "A true master of the arts!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.21.T: "Huguenot Refugees"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.21.D: "The relatively tolerant order established in France after the French Wars of Religion is rapidly deteriorating. The rise of absolutism in our larger neighbor has led to the revocation of legal protections for the French minority of Protestants known as Huguenots. In addition, the continued actions of the Inquisition in Spain and religious conflicts ongoing in Germany have made our Republic into an island of peace and stability. While constant conflict in Europe results in rampant poverty, in Amsterdam there are always jobs! \nNaturally, these people of all faiths wish to seek a better life in our trading cities."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.21.OPT1: "By all means, let them in!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.21.OPT2: "They would only bring all their problems here"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.22.T: "Dike Piercing"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.22.D: "Come my friends, the Dutch are going to war! It is likely that we go to our doom. The last march of the Dutch!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.22.OPT1: "Break the dikes! Release the water!"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.22.OPT2: "Our business is to fight, not flee!"

 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.23.T: "Lack of Investment in Manufacturing "
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.23.D: "Our dominance of the global trade networks has brought unprecedented wealth to our shores. Even as other nations begin to copy our techniques for trade and ship-building, we ourselves have become complacent. Many merchants seem content to continue accruing profit from existing trade routes, heedless of the looming competition, while our investors find foreign opportunities more lucrative than our own nation swamped in excess capital. \nOur emphasis on trade has led us this far, but an investment into our nations manufacturing capacity is critical if we are to avoid being left behind by other nations. Alternatively, some suggest that we could pawn our gains from trade back into the finances markets which so helped us before, that we may create a self-reinforcing cycle of financial growth without additional spending or investment."
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.23.OPT1: "The world is changing, and industry is the future"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.23.OPT2: "The investment of capital is core to a nation’s success"
 FEE_Low_Countries_Events.23.OPT3: "Trade is the lifeblood of nations, we would be foolish to abandon it now"
