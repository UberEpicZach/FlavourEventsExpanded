 hee_barbary.1.t:0 "Barbary Pirates Seek Privateer Contracts"
 hee_barbary.1.d:0 "Piracy in the Mediterranean and the capture of Christian slaves has been increasing for a long time, in no small thanks due to sponsorship from the Ottoman Sultanate. Over the course of the 16th and 17th century, so-called \"Barbary Corsairs\" were one of the greatest threats to Christian ships in the Mediterranean, and their dreadful raids prevented most settlement along the coast of Spain and Southern Italy. \n\nDistant naval expeditions are challenging however, and impossible without a port to call home. We have been approached by a group of pirates who wish to enter into a privateer contract with us, and use one of our ports as their base of operations.\nIn addition to harassing the coastal settlements of the infidels of Europe, they promise they will be bringing a wealth of taken goods and slaves through our lands."
 hee_barbary.1.a:0 "Of course our ports are open to them!"
 hee_barbary.1.tt:0 "This will bring many opportunities, and much terror to the Christians of the Mediterrenean."
 hee_barbary.1.b:0 "It is better to trade with the Christians than rob them."
 hee_barbary.2.t:0 "Sponsor Barbary Raid"
 hee_barbary.2.d:0 "The Barbary Corsairs operating out of our ports are planning a major expedition against a coastal town in Europe. Their preparations seem to be more for a military expedition than a piratical raid, but they swear they will be bringing back as much loot and as many slaves as their ships can bear.\nOf course, their captain assures us, they could bring much more if the king were to assist with a few more ships..."
 hee_barbary.2.a:0 "Of course we will sponsor this attack on the Christians!"
 hee_barbary.2.b:0 "We will use our naval strength to dominate the Mediterranean in other ways."
 hee_barbary.3.t:0 "$PROVINCE$ Raided by Barbary Corsairs"
 hee_barbary.3.d:0 "They came without warning on the northern wind. In the early morning, pirates flying the flag of one of the North African emirates descended on a town in $PROVINCE$. Now there is nothing left but burning ruins and refugees that escaped slavery."
 hee_barbary.3.a:0 "Cruel monsters!"
 hee_barbary.3.b:0 "We must do everything we can to help the town rebuild."
 hee_barbary.4.t:0 "Barbary Raid on $PROVINCE$ Repelled!"
 hee_barbary.4.d:0 "They came early in the morning with the northern wind, to pillage and enslave, but we had warning. A fisherman had spotted their ships off the coast a few days before, and troops were sent to every town nearby. Once the Barbary Corsairs landed, our brave soldiers engaged the infidels in fierce battle. They hadn’t expected such resistance, and soon fell back to their ships. Our troops managed to set fire to one of their vessels, but the rest fled back to the North African emirate whose flags they flew.\nThey might return one day, but for now $PROVINCE$ is safe."
 hee_barbary.4.a:0 "$COUNTRY$ remains ever vigilant."
 hee_barbary.5.t:0 "Raid Returns With Spoils"
 hee_barbary.5.d:0 "Our support of the Corsairs has paid dividends. As their ships anchored in the harbour, it became clear just how heavily loaded they were. Carts of stolen silver, wheat for weeks, and column after column of valuable slaves were brought ashore.\nNot only is it our right to tax all this, the monarch is entitled to a significant share for his support."
 hee_barbary.5.a:0 "Blessings upon us!"
 hee_barbary.6.t:0 "Raid Returns in Failure"
 hee_barbary.6.d:0 "Unthinkable. Not only did the expedition fail to loot and capture the town they settled on, several of their ships were lost in the attack! The Christians must have known the corsairs were coming, or just been exceedingly lucky, but that doesn’t change the fact that this expedition has cost us dearly."
 hee_barbary.6.a:0 "How could this happen to us?"
 hee_barbary.7.t:0 "Retaliation for Corsair Attacks"
 hee_barbary.7.d:0 "The attacks from Barbary Corsairs are getting fiercer and more frequent, and there is no doubt who is letting them - nay, encouraging them to continue. Our people will not feel safe until the threat is dealt with.\nIt is time to act."
 hee_barbary.7.a:0 "They raid our coast, we bombard theirs."
 hee_barbary.7.b:0 "This has gone on long enough. We need to truly make them pay."
 hee_barbary.7.c:0 "They are across the coast. There is nothing we can do."
 hee_barbary.8.t:0 "\"Retaliation\" for Barbary Raids"
 hee_barbary.8.d:0 "Disaster has struck. A Christian contingent landed on our shores to slaughter innocent citizens. They are claiming it is revenge for similar attacks on their towns and cities, and have the temerity to accuse us of piracy, as if we are lowly thieves!"
 hee_barbary.8.a:0 "Such insults will not stand!"
 hee_barbary.8.b:0 "We must seek reconciliation, for the good of all."
 hee_barbary.9.t:0 "Barbary Corsairs Plaguing Trade Route"
 hee_barbary.9.d:0 "Barbary Corsairs, pirates supported by the Ottoman Empire and the emirates of North Africa, have long been a severe threat in the Medeterranean, both for ships and coastal settlements, which they raid for plunder and slaves.\nNow they have started moving in on what we have long considered our safest trade route, and with a ship going missing seemingly every other day, our merchants are suffering."
 hee_barbary.9.a:0 "We must increase patrols and keep them at bay."
 hee_barbary.9.b:0 "That's just the risk of travel at sea."
 hee_barbary.10.t:0 "Decline of the Barbary Corsairs"
 hee_barbary.10.d:0 "Barbary pirates would continue to harass ships in the Mediterranean long into the 19th century. However, towards the end of the 17th European ships started being equipped with more advanced weaponry, making raiding ships challenging, and ensuring greater safety on most trade routes used by the Christians. This meant that while still something to be wary of, barbary corsairs were no longer the horror of the sea they had once been."
 hee_barbary.10.a:0 "One golden age has ended. May another begin."
