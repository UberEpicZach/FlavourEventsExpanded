 fee_VEN.1.t: "Il Ridotto"
 fee_VEN.1.d: "As the original European casino, Il Ridotto was a government-owned gambling house that formalised gambling and exessive money loss in Venice in 1638. It was established once the Great Council gave up on preventing people from playing for money during the Carnivale. Eventually, people from across Europe would come to Venice to test their luck, and hopefully make a quick fortune. While the wing of the San Moisè Palace was supposedly open to the public, only nobles could afford the high stakes played with there.\n\nWhile money flowed freely for more than a century, gambling was outlawed and Il Ridotto was closed in 1774."
 fee_VEN.1.a: "Oh yes, let's fleece 'em!"
