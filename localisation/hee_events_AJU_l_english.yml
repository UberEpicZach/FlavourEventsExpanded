 hee_AJU.1.t: "Integrating Mogadishu Currency"
 hee_AJU.1.d: "Following the absorption of the lands of the state of Mogadishu into our sultanate, we have found several ways their proficiency in trade and administration can aid us. However, if we are to benefit from their strategic development, we cannot break from their economic system. It is therefore prudent if we let their mints run, and adopt their currency as a part of our empire's system of exchange."
 hee_AJU.1.a: "Integrate their currency into our own."
 hee_AJU.1.b: "One sultante, one currency."
 hee_AJU.2.t: "Toob Menadir"
 hee_AJU.2.d: "At the height of the Ajuuraan Sultanate, Mogadishu was home to a thriving weaving industry. The production houses, known collectively as \"toob menadir,\" produced woolen cloth specifically for the markets in Egypt and Syria.\nThe cloth traveled with merchants up along the Gulf of Aden, and was dispersed throughout the region on caravans. The cloth was highly priced, and the weaving industry brought much wealth and trade through Mogadishu."
 hee_AJU.2.a: "Encourage toob menadir and further trade with the Middle East."
 hee_AJU.2.b: "This fine cloth is better suited for our palaces."
 hee_AJU.3.t: "Toob Menadir Trade"
 hee_AJU.3.d: "At the height of the Ajuuraan Sultanate, Mogadishu was home to a thriving weaving industry. The production houses, known collectively as \"toob menadir,\" produced woolen cloth specifically for the markets in Egypt and Syria.\nThe cloth traveled with merchants up along the Gulf of Aden, and was dispersed throughout the region on caravans. The cloth was highly priced, and taxation of the material gives a nice addition to our coffers."
 hee_AJU.3.a: "This is beautiful cloth."
 hee_AJU.4.t: "The Ajuran Army"
 hee_AJU.4.d: "Our empire has traditionally consisted of a standing army of foreign mamlukes. As they have no connection to any of the tribes of our lands, they are far more effective at keeping the peace within our borders.\n\nHowever, many believe that they are far less effective at protecting our borders than a force consisting of natural-born citizens would be."
 hee_AJU.4.a: "We must conscript local soldiers."
 hee_AJU.4.b: "Mercenaries are the best soldiers we can get."
 hee_AJU.5.t: "Islamic Immigration"
 hee_AJU.5.d: "Due to instability in other parts of the world, immigrants flock to our empire. Whether they are fleeing the inquisition in Spain or warfare on the Arabian peninsula, or simply hope to build a better life, they are all being welcomed. Among many of these are people well learned in theology, science and the arts of war, which could come to benefit our country greatly."
 hee_AJU.5.a: "Welcome advisors to aid our rule."
 hee_AJU.5.b: "They should serve in our armies."
 hee_AJU.5.c: "Make a plan to settle them in our capital."
