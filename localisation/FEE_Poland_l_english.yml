 FEE_Poland_Events.1.T: "The Union of Brest"
 FEE_Poland_Events.1.D: "The shattering of the unity of Latin Christendom by the Reformation is in full swing. Even among those monarchs that have stayed true to the Catholic faith, the division in Christendom ushered in a period of great adjustment. In Eastern Europe, the division between Catholic and Orthodox meant a long tradition of believers who officially considered each other heretics living side-by-side. More than anywhere else, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has embraced fundamental ideas of religious tolerance and personal freedom. To further these ideals in a time of unrest, King [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proposed a Treaty of Union between Catholic and Orthodox. This Union would effectively outflank Protestantism by the acceptance of Papal authority by the entrenched Orthodox clergy in return for a guarantee of freedom to practice Orthodox rituals. However, if we do this, many in our realm who now practice Catholicism for political gain may revert to their old faith, making the Orthodox more influential than previously thought..."
 FEE_Poland_Events.1.OPT1: "Together, as one!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.1.OPT2: "We cannot compromise with heretics!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.9.T: "The Statutes of Nieszawa"
 FEE_Poland_Events.9.D: "Przywilej cerekwicko-nieszawski were laws enacted in Poland in 1454, that gave the nobles, the szlachta, several priveliges and concessions. The laws stated that the king required the approval of the nobles when issuing new laws, levying forces or introducing new taxes. \nThe reason king Casimir IV Jagiellon agreed to this was the need for support in the Thirteen Years War against the Teutonic Order. While the war led towards the absorption of the Teutonic lands into Poland, the Statutes of Nieszawa laid the groundwork for the coming conflicts between the king and the szlachta."
 FEE_Poland_Events.9.OPT1: "Accept the conventions."
 FEE_Poland_Events.9.OPT2: "Refuse to sign and defy the Magnates!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.10.T: "Statutes of Piotrokow"
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.D: "Konstytucje piotrkowskie was a collection of laws passed in 1496 under king John I Olbracht who, in the tradition of his forebears, made concessions to the szlachta in exchange for their support in war. The szlachta were guaranteed certain rights, including relief from specific taxes and exclusive access to some Church offices. \nThe laws also affected the situation of peasants in the country, restricting them to their lands. After 1496, only one peasant from each village could leave per year, and only one person from a given peasant family was allowed to move to the growing towns. City burghers were also restricted from holding royal and national offices. \nFinally, the statues emphasised the rivers of Poland, removing all internal tariffs on waterways."
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.OPT1: "Enact as the szlactha require."
 FEE_Poland_Events.10.OPT2: "The king will not be forced!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.11.T: "Union of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.D: "Unia krakowsko-wileñska was an attempt at taking a major step in the unification of Poland and Lithuania. It was signed by both Polish and Lithuanian nobles in 1499, and described two equal states in perpetual alliance. The countries would select their own leaders with the approval of the other, but would always support each other in armed conflicts. \nHowever, the Union did not last long in that state. Polish nobles soon began to protest it, mainly because it emphasised Lithuania as much as Poland. The reasoning they gave however, was that it was based on an old union of 1413, which they claimed there was no evidence for."
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.OPT1: "Our countries should cooperate."
 FEE_Poland_Events.11.OPT2: "Our countries are better off as just friends."

 FEE_Poland_Events.12.T: "The Privilege of Mielnik"
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.D: "The Przywilej mielnicki was an act passed by king Alexander Jagiellon in 1501, that expanded the powers of the magnates and the Sejm, to the point where it practically introduced a republican form of government. The king lost many rights, and was effectively demoted to the head of the Sejm, which held all real power. \nHowever, after being elected as head of the Sejm, the king never confirmed the priveliges, and it gradually became apparent that the struggle between the king and the greater Sejm harmed the nobles more than the new status quo helped them. \nIn 1504, the legal change was rejected by the Sejm, and while the struggle between the nobles and the king would continue for a long time, this battle had ended in Alexander's favor."
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.OPT1: "Grant the privilege."
 FEE_Poland_Events.12.OPT2: "Reject these outrageous demands!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.13.T: "The Union of Mielnik"
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.D: "The Unia mielnicka was one of the first attempts to unite Poland and Lithuania into a single state. Previously the two countries had co-existed in personal union through the king, but the Union of Mielnik would unite them into a single entity. The suggestion of the union was not well-received in Lithuania, as Polish magnates were attempting to force Polish culture and traditions onto the other country, and nobles there led a revolt against the Poles. In the end, the union was neither ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas or the Polish Sejm, and the countries remained separate in personal union for nearly seventy years more before they were finally united. "
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.OPT1: "Unite our nations under Poland. (This will cause massive revolts among the Lithuanians.)"
 FEE_Poland_Events.13.OPT2: "Don't force anyone to sign this."

 FEE_Poland_Events.14.T: "Lithuanians Revolt Against the Union"
 FEE_Poland_Events.14.D: "After the introduction of the Union of Mielnik, Lithuanian nobles have banded together in massive numbers to rise up against their Polish counterparts. Through the union, magnates have insisted on instituting Polish language in education and bureaucracy, as well as rule by Polish traditions. Now the Lithuanians have decided to fight back with arms."
 FEE_Poland_Events.14.OPT1: "You were warned."

 FEE_Poland_Events.15.T: "1504 Reforms Passed Before the King"
 FEE_Poland_Events.15.D: "In 1504, the Sejm piotrowski passed measures to restrict the king's control over the national treasury, effectively placing the Sejm in control of state funds. \nThe Sejm did not get the measures passed without negotiation, however. Nobles were from now on forbidden from holding more than a single official administrative post. In addition, Polish magnates had to return much land that had previously been seized from the king, thereby compensating somewhat for the financial authority the king lost."
 FEE_Poland_Events.15.OPT1: "You lose some, you... win some?"

 FEE_Poland_Events.16.T: "Nothing New Without the Common Consent"
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.D: "Nihil novi nisi commune consensu was an act adopted by the Sejm in 1505 at Radom. It forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. This consent would be given through the Senat and the Chamber of Deputies. \nThe only exceptions were laws governing royal cities, crown lands, mines, fiefdoms, royal peasants, and Jews. These exceptions can be traced by the meaning of the law's name in Polish, \"Nothing About Us Without Us.\""
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.OPT1: "The nobles can be of great aid."
 FEE_Poland_Events.16.OPT2: "This is too far! No more power to the nobles!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.17.T: "The Privilege of Torun"
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.D: "Przywilej toruñski was enacted in 1520 by the Polish king, granting the szlachta greater control over people living on their lands. Peasants were forced to pay serfdom to their masters, and prevented them from leaving their villages. This was a part of the greater trend of introducing serfdom in Eastern Europe at the time, as encouraging peasant settlers was no longer considered as necessary at it had been in earlier centuries. The Privilege defined Polish serfdom for the next century, before it gradually declined under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After nearly three centuries, the state's attitude would reverse into constitutional state protection for all peasants."
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.OPT1: "Serfdom is the way of the future!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.17.OPT2: "We can't give these predatory nobles more power."

 FEE_Poland_Events.18.T: "The Prussian Homage"
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.D: "Hołd pruski was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as Duke of Prussia under the Polish crown. \nPoland required every new Grand Master of the Order to pay homage to the king, and a refusal to do so had resulted in lasting conflict between the Order and Poland, culminating in the Polish-Teutonic War. The war dragged on, and with renewed incursions of the Ottomans into Christian lands, the two states agreed to an armistice that would see the Teutonic Order secularised into a Polish dukedom. In the main square of Krakow, Albert publicly resigned as Grand Master before receiving the title Duke of Prussia from King Zygmunt the Old."
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.OPT1: "Establish Prussia as a royal fief."
 FEE_Poland_Events.18.OPT2: "The Order serves our purpose."

 FEE_Poland_Events.19.T: "Tumult of Danzig"
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.D: "The Tumult gdanski was a 1525 revolt by Lutheran burghers against the mayor of Danzig, Eberhard Ferber. The mayor was suspected of defrauding money from the city under the protection of the Crown Chancellor. As the revolt developed it took on a religious tone, and even though the mayor resigned, the refusal of the Chancellor to show the city accounts meant that riots continued. \nThe Protestant burghers closed Catholic churches and introduced their own preachers to replace pastors. As the city came under their control, the commoners demanded the removal of the city from the juridistiction of the local bishop, and a delegation sent to Martin Luther asked the priest to send teachers of the new faith. \nHowever, a year after the tumult started and two months after the burghers had seized complete control of the city, King Sigismund and the prince of Pommerania led an army into the city, putting down the revolt and beheading its leaders, restoring the old order to Danzig."
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.OPT1: "These people must be stopped at all costs!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.19.OPT2: "Live and let live."

 FEE_Poland_Events.20.T: "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.D: "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia. \nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.OPT1: "Incorporate Livonia, for their own good."
 FEE_Poland_Events.20.OPT2: "We don't have the capacity to administer those lands."

 FEE_Poland_Events.21.T: "Karnkowski's Statute"
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.D: "Statut karnkowskiego was a law enacted in 1570 by Stanislav Karnkowski, the bishop of Kujawy and Great Secretary of the Crown. The law gave the Polish king full authority over all matters of the sea, with the intention of improving Poland's naval capabilities in the Baltic Sea. The act led to extensive naval development in Danzig, but had no great effect beyond that due to the death of king Sigismund II August died, and the fact that his successor had little interest in competing for naval supremacy."
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.OPT1: "Expand the rights of the king."
 FEE_Poland_Events.21.OPT2: "We don't need this."

 FEE_Poland_Events.22.T: "The Prussian Homage"
 FEE_Poland_Events.22.D: "The Prussian Homage was the investment of the former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order as the duke of the secularised Ducal Prussia, a fief under the Polish Crown. \nThis fit well with Albert of Prussia's newfound Protestantism, as it allowed Prussia to no longer be a subject of the papacy. \nIt seems that our overlord has similarly decided that it is time we came properly under their wing as a secular duchy."
 FEE_Poland_Events.22.OPT1: "Humble before the Polish King."

 FEE_Poland_Events.23.T: "The Treaty of Vilnius"
 FEE_Poland_Events.23.D: "The Pakt wileñski was concluded between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Livonian Confederation in 1561, during the Livonian War. With the exception of the Free Imperial City of Riga, the Treaty brought all the Livonian states that were not occupied by Denmark or Sweden under the suzerainty of the Commonwealth. It also secularised the Livonian Order into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalla and the Duchy of Livonia. \nWhile the treaty finally lost Livonia its independence, in the eyes of the Polish state it rescued the Livonian lands from Russian aggression and inevitable conquest."

 FEE_Poland_Events.23.OPT2: "We are stronger on our own!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.24.T: "Zaporozhian Cossack Raids"
 FEE_Poland_Events.24.D: "Since second half of XVI century, they have been devastatingly raiding our territories, including our wealthy merchant port cities. Although Commonwealth crown cannot control their actions directly, they are still responsible for this.\n\nWe could threaten their king with war if they won't tame these annoying vermins. Yet there is a chance that they won't back off, and in that case we would have to talk reason into them with fire and sword."
 FEE_Poland_Events.24.OPT1: "Send an ultimatum!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.24.OPT2: "We should not jump into any rash decisions."

 FEE_Poland_Events.25.T: "Threatened by the Ottomans"
 FEE_Poland_Events.25.D: "Ruler of the Ottomans, [TUR.Monarch.GetName] threatens our country with war if the Zaporozhian Cossacks continue their raids.\n\nKnowing that raids is one of the main sources of income for the Cossacks, taking any restrictive action against them would severely damage their loyalty towards us.\n\nOn the other hand, war with Ottomans and their allies could turn into an unspeakable catastrophe for us, unless we are absolutely sure that we can take them on."
 FEE_Poland_Events.25.OPT1: "We certainly should do something about that."
 FEE_Poland_Events.25.OPT2: "We don't take orders from the devilish infidel! Bring them on!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.26.T: "Commonwealth accepts our demands"
 FEE_Poland_Events.26.D: "[PLC.Monarch.GetTitle] [PLC.Monarch.GetName] assured us that they will take actions against the Cossacks which will be sufficient enough to stop their raids."

 FEE_Poland_Events.28.T: "A Conflict between Ruthenian Nobility"
 FEE_Poland_Events.28.D: "Krzysztof Kosinski, a colonel of the Registered Cossacks in Kiev Voivodship captured Bila Tserkva in the retaliation against Janusz Ostrogski, who deprived of his estate in the villages of Rokitno and Olsznice earlier.\n\n This conflict doesn't seem one that we should be bothered about."
 FEE_Poland_Events.28.OPT1: "This is a private matter of these nobles. Do not intrude."

 FEE_Poland_Events.29.T: "Ruthenian Noble names himself a Hetman"
 FEE_Poland_Events.29.D: "After Kosinski captured Bila Tserkva, he named himself a Hetman of the Cossacks and with that kindled a full-scale revolt against the rule of the Polish crown and the local Ruthenian Nobility.\n\nAlthough it looks bad, our chancellor assures us that it's just yet another struggle for power in this unruly region so we shouldn't mobilize our troops for intervention and Ostrogski family, perhaps the most powerful noble family in Ruthenia is more than capable of dealing with that themselves."
 FEE_Poland_Events.29.OPT1: "Let's keep a close eye on it."

 FEE_Poland_Events.30.T: "End of Kosinski Uprising"
 FEE_Poland_Events.30.D: "After a week of fierce fighting near the village of Piatek, the Cossacks, as expected, have been defeated by Duke Kostanty Wasyl Ostrogski. The leader of revolt was forced sign an agreement in which the Cossacks were obliged to be loyal to the crown, deprive Kosinski of his Hetman status and remove from the Cossack Register everyone who had been added to it during the revolt."
 FEE_Poland_Events.30.OPT1: "One less issue to worry about."

 FEE_Poland_Events.31.T: "Embarrassing Failure"
 FEE_Poland_Events.31.D: "What seemed like an usual rebellion that would've been an easy prey for Ruthenian Nobility couldn't have been handled by them. Their combined forces got completely outmaneuvered and crushed by the Cossacks!\n\nConsidering how poorly equipped this rebellion is, this defeat will become an embarrassment for the entire country!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.31.OPT1: "We must put them down ourselves before it's too late!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.32.T: "End of Kosinski Uprising"
 FEE_Poland_Events.32.D: "After short clashes between our army and the rebels, we have managed to deliver a decisive blow to the rebellion and capture Kosinski himself in one of the battles. He was forced to sign an agreement in which the Cossacks were obliged to be loyal to the crown, deprive Kosinski of his Hetman status and remove from the Cossack Register everyone who had been added to it during the revolt."
 FEE_Poland_Events.32.OPT1: "That was surely a close call!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.33.T: "An influental Cossack demands changes"
 FEE_Poland_Events.33.D: "Severyn Nalyvaiko, after leaving our service have sent the list of demands to the Szlachta. This list contained demands for the changes to the upkeep of the Cossack regiments which served in their armies. This included respect for the Cossack customs. He is justifying his demands with Cossack's active involvements against infidels from the south.\n\nAlthough it's hard to deny that, the Szlachta is not willing to sway towards accepting the demands. Considering the recent uprising, rejecting them might lead to unpredictable concequences."

 FEE_Poland_Events.34.T: "Szlachta Agrees"
 FEE_Poland_Events.34.D: "Despite the opposition to the demands, majority of the Szlachta had decided that it will be better to improve conditions of the upkeep for the Cossack regiments rather than risk provoking yet another devastating revolt in Ruthenia."
 FEE_Poland_Events.34.OPT1: "They gotta be grateful to us for this!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.35.T: "Szlachta Refuses"
 FEE_Poland_Events.35.D: "As we had anticipated, majority of Szlachta refused to agree to the demands, in fact, some of the nobles tried to knock Nalyvaiko out of his residence in Braclaw, which resulted in a total failure and left us with no opportunities for any further negotiations for now."
 FEE_Poland_Events.35.OPT1: "This doesn't look good, but let's hold crown troops for now."

 FEE_Poland_Events.36.T: "Szlachta Requests our Help"
 FEE_Poland_Events.36.D: "Not being able to deal with the Cossacks, Szlachta from Ruthenia sent us a delegation. They have asked for out help, complaining that the Cossacks are even more annoying than Tatars. They've also reported about atrocities that rebels had committed against Polish nobility and Catholic clergy in Mahilyow.\n\nAt the same time, we have received a peace offer from Nalyvaiko in which he requires us to cede some of the lands in exchange for their military service and loyalty to the Commonwealth. Now, we have a choice how to end this. Either we accept peace offer and bring an end to this quickly. Or we can drown Ruthenian lands in blood once again."
 FEE_Poland_Events.36.OPT1: "Recall our Field Crown Hetman and order him to deal with this!"
 FEE_Poland_Events.36.OPT2: "This went way too far, the peace must be reached!"

 FEE_Poland_Events.37.T: "End of Nalyvaiko Uprising"
 FEE_Poland_Events.37.D: "Having agreed to the peace offer, we have brought an end to the uprising. The captured cities were ceded to us and prisoners freed. Unfortunately, due to the contraditcory nature of this peace offer, some of the Nobility desperately took up arms against us, trying to revert that.\n\nUnlike previous rebellion, this one due to the usage of scorched earth tactics severely devastated left-bank Ukraine."
 FEE_Poland_Events.37.OPT1: "Is this truly over?"

 FEE_Poland_Events.38.T: "Rebels Were Forced to Retreat"
 FEE_Poland_Events.38.D: "After bloody clashes with the rebels, we have forced Nalyvaiko and the rest of his army to retreat to the left-bank Ukraine, to the village Solonystsy near the town of Lubnie. There he organized a tabor."

 FEE_Poland_Events.40.D: "Surrounded in Solonytsy for already quite a while, the rebels are sure to run out of food and water soon.\n\nIf we were to offer them appealing conditions of surrender, we could end the uprising fast and perhaps without any further bloodshed."

 FEE_Poland_Events.41.T: "Negotiations with Rebels"
 FEE_Poland_Events.41.D: "It seems that these rebels are either hard nuts to crack or just crazy. The terms that we have offered them were rejected, so that leaves us with no other choice but to siege their tabor down."

 FEE_Poland_Events.42.T: "Negotiations with Rebels"
 FEE_Poland_Events.42.D: "Although the rebels have accepted our proposal to negotiate, everything went not as we expected, but even better. One of the negotiators from the Cossack side, Hryhory Loboda was suspected of treason by the rebels and murdered. Later, the rebels offered to hand over the leaders of the rebellion, including Nalyvaiko on the same terms.\n\nOf course we can agree to this, but considering the havoc and destructions the had caused, our Nobility is expecting from us to deal with every single one of them accordingly."

 FEE_Poland_Events.44.T: "End of Nalyvaiko Uprising"
 FEE_Poland_Events.44.D: "Storming the tabor, our army slaughtered everyone related to the Cossacks, including their families. Only a small amount of the Cossacks was able to break out. With their leaders in our hands, we have brought an end to the uprising. Due to scale of the damage suffered by the Nobility, the lands of the Cossacks are going to be confiscated in favour of them. As for Nalyvaiko and the rest of the leader, their punishment will be severe and cruel."

 FEE_Poland_Events.45.T: "Suspicious Cossack"
 FEE_Poland_Events.45.D: "Well-respected among his friends and subordinates, Registered Cossack Bohdan Khmelnytsky, after receiving no support from the Polish officials in his land dispute against Daniel Czaplinski who, on behalf of Magnate Aleksander Koniecpolski, had tried to force him off the land by committing raids to Subotiv, his residence, is suspiciously traveling from one Cossack regiment to another and thus seems to be plotting another Cossack revolt."
