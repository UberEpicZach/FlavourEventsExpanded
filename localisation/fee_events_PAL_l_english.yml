 FEE_Palatinate_Events.1.T: "Ernst von Mansfeld"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.1.D: "A nobleman previously unknown to us has arrived in court. Calling himself Ernst, count von Mansfeld, he has experience in wars in Hungary under the Habsburg army, where he claims rank ingratitude for his performance drove him away to seek employment elsewhere. \nAlthough a Catholic himself, he swears undying allegiance to our cause… Provided, of course, we pay him."
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.1.OPT1: "Let us see what he can do for us!"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.1.OPT2: "We cannot trust him… better not"

 FEE_Palatinate_Events.2.T: "Imperial Duties and Salic Law"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.2.D: "Under the Golden Bull of 1356, which established the Holy Roman Empire as an elective monarchy, the Elector-Palatine and the Prince Elector of Saxony were entrusted with the Imperial Vicarship. This entrusted the two electors as “the administrators of the empire itself… receiving oaths of fealty for and in the name of the empire.” This reinforced the two electors’ ancient role as stewards under Frankish law from the time of Charlemagne himself. \nIn practice, this meant that the respective regions assigned to the princes were administered bythe princes whenever there was an interregnum between emperors. This grew less and less frequent as years passed and as House von Habsburg obtained a semi-permanent hold on the imperial throne. \nDespite this shift, however, we may yet be able to leverage our lawfully granted privileges as vicars to assert our own political authority in the region. Failing that, we could at least use it for diplomatic advantage or to improve our internal stability."
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.2.OPT1.PAL: "It is time our neighbors acknowledge our authority"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.2.OPT1.SAX: "It is time our neighbors acknowledge our authority"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.2.OPT2: "Let us be generous to our neighbors – it is our imperial responsibility, after all!"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.2.OPT3: "Reform our Legal System using Salic Law – this can only strengthen our throne!"

 FEE_Palatinate_Events.3.T: "The Clevian Succession"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.3.D: "The same Salic Law codes which granted us our own rights and privileges has caused a succession crisis in Cleves as they have no eligible heir within their own borders. Both our house and the Margraves of Brandenburg, however, have legitimate claims to the throne there. We must act quickly to secure our own claims, or risk a splitting of the Duchy, or worse, the entirety falling to the House of Brandenburg."
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.3.OPT1: "Let us move to secure our lawful claim"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.3.OPT2: "We cannot afford to overextend ourselves or risk the ire of House von Hohenzollern"

 FEE_Palatinate_Events.4.T: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Renovations"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.4.D: "In the midst of the increasing turmoil of the Reformation, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided that, rather than zealous outreach and martial conflict, the Palatinate should endeavor to be an example of Christian beauty and peace by embarking on a building campaign to make the Palatinate the jewel of the Empire, including a royal garden in Heidelberg fit for the ancient kings of Babylon themselves. \nHowever, carrying out all of the elector’s goals might prove immensely costly given our small treasury."
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.4.OPT1: "Spare no Expense!"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.4.OPT2: "Let us be conservative"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.4.OPT3: "Redirect the funds to more pressing matters"

 FEE_Palatinate_Events.5.T: "Development of Amberg"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.5.D: "Despite its status as a disputed territory between Bavaria and the Palatinate, the region surrounding Amberg has developed a thriving economy based around its mining industry. The presence of Palatinate fortifications has helped secure this source of wealth, but more remains to be done to really ensure that the productivity of Amberg’s mines can translate into a wealthier princedom as a whole."
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.5.OPT1: "Let us grant royal protections and patronage to the good people of Amberg"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.5.OPT2: "The city has done just fine on its own; no need to interfere"

 FEE_Palatinate_Events.6.T: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] converts to Reformed"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.6.D: "Despite his strict [Root.Religion.GetName] upbringing, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has always been eager to find a way to mend the rift between the various branches of Christianity, inviting theologians from all around the empire to the Palatinate. To understand the controversy, he has spent countless nights in solitude studying theological works. Perhaps too many nights; [Root.Monarch.GetName] has recently stunned his court by making a ringing profession of the Reformed faith, sure to make a stir in [Root.Religion.GetName] Palatinate. He has proposed to commission a catechism to summarize and educate Palatinate citizens in the tenets of the Reformed faith. \nEven more shocking, [Root.Monarch.GetName] made an appearance in the Imperial Diet itself, giving a fiery and eloquent speech that only God may judge a prince’s religion, not the Emperor!"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.6.OPT1: "Surely, he has God on his side to say such bold and inspiring words!"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.6.OPT2: "Let us keep this in our own border and not risk angering the emperor again"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.6.OPT3: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has gone too far and must be stopped!"

 FEE_Palatinate_Events.7.T: "The Saxon Envoy"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.7.D: "As religious tension in the empire mounts ever higher, the Prince of Saxony, the most influential of the protestant princes, has approached us with a proposition: while an Evangelical Union is even now being negotiated, a proper alliance between the two most powerful Protestant electors might allow for closer coordination within the League, giving a valuable military edge if conflict were to erupt."
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.7.OPT1: "Alliance with Saxony"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.7.OPT2: "We are better off without Saxon Involvement"

 FEE_Palatinate_Events.8.T: "The Winter King"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.8.D: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]’s ambitions of ruling Bohemia have come to a head – now outright war has ensued! However, although well led, the Palatinate’s forces may yet be outnumbered and outgunned by those would stop [Root.Monarch.GetName] from attaining one of the most prestigious thrones in the Empire. However, instability over the succession in Bohemia has led to a number of Palatinate sympathizers within the country to prepare a speedy entrance for us in advance of our arrival. \nIn order to take advantage of this, however, we must act quickly: a lightning-fast war through the winter, when most armies would shelter in place, is needed to gain enough initiative to ensure victory. We must be both swift and cunning if we are to succeed!"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.8.OPT1: "Winter is Coming"

 FEE_Palatinate_Events.9.T: "King of Bohemia"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.9.D: "Having been elected by the Bohemian estates-general as well as winning the war against other claimants to the throne [Root.Monarch.GetName] lost no time in further legitimizing his kingship by holding an ornate coronation at St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, blending Catholic, Protestant, Hussite, and Reformed elements of worship. \nWhile he claimed at least in part to take the crown for the protection of Bohemians’ religious rights, the other princes of the empire are none too pleased with perceived Palatine interference in Bohemian succession. The princes of the League have demanded that [Root.Monarch.GetName] abdicate as King of Bohemia immediately, else risk losing their support in the League. [Root.Monarch.GetName], for his part, believes that to do so would be to “resist the will of the Almighty.” Even worse news is on the horizon, however, as the Emperor has declared this union unlawful, claiming that as emperor he has rightful authority under Imperial Law to choose Bohemia’s king. If that king happens to be himself, well… who can argue with the Emperor?"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.9.OPT1: "What God has joined together, let no man tear asunder!."
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.9.OPT2: "Attempt to Appease the League (AI never chooses this)"
 FEE_Palatinate_Events.9.OPT3: "The Emperor is the Supreme Authority – we must bend here (AI never chooses this)"
