 FEE_Western_India_Events.1.T: "Berserker Elephants"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.1.D: "In the heart of Western India, a tradition as ancient as the riding of elephants themselves unfolded on the battlefields. The era of the berserker elephants, a practice both revered and feared, where these majestic beasts were transformed into formidable siege engines. To many, it might have seemed cruel, but in the theatre of war, it was a strategy of immense importance. They would clad their elephants in vast amounts of armour, turning them into nearly indestructible forces of nature. Atop these armoured giants, they erected small wooden or bamboo towers, resembling miniature fortresses. Archers would man these turrets, raining arrows upon the enemy from an elevated vantage point, while the elephants themselves became living siege towers, breaching smaller walls with ease. For grander fortifications, the elephants took on the role of battering rams. With their immense strength and the protection of their armour, they would charge at gates, shattering them and allowing troops to storm through with a height advantage, commanding the battlefield from the backs of their mighty steeds. These siege elephants provided not just a means to break through enemy defences but also a way to control the chaos of gate breaches, maintaining order and momentum in the thick of battle. As time marched on and the advent of gunpowder reshaped warfare, the berserker elephants momentarily fell out of favour. Yet, the innovation did not cease. Ingenious minds soon discovered that these colossal creatures could bear the weight of small cannons on their backs, transforming them once more into critical assets on the battlefield. Towers filled with soldiers wielding rifles replaced the archers, bringing a new era of firepower to the age-old practice. However, the arrival of European powers marked the decline of these extraordinary war elephants. The Europeans, with their own military doctrines and technologies, refused to deploy elephants in such a manner, leading to the eventual disappearance of the berserker elephants from the annals of war."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.1.OPT2: "At all costs!"

 FEE_Western_India_Events.2.T: "Accept or Resist?"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.2.D: "In the ancient lands of western India, the sun rose and set upon kingdoms ruled by Hindu princes who held fast to their ancestral thrones. For 700 years, the Islamic Empires of Hindustan had spread its influence, its banners casting long shadows over the fields and palaces of these princely states. The balance of power hung in a delicate dance. As the years turned to centuries, the princes of Western India found themselves embroiled in an unending struggle. Not merely a battle of swords and shields, but a fight to preserve the very essence of their culture and heritage against the tide of a burgeoning Islamic dominance. The empire, with its vast resources and mighty armies, sought to extend its control. But the Hindu princes, proud and unyielding, stood firm, their hearts burning with the desire to maintain their sovereignty and protect their people. In the court of the princely state of [Root.GetName], tensions are running high. The air was thick with the weight of decisions yet to be made, and the echoes of history reverberated through the grand halls. [Root.Monarch.GetName], the valiant warrior king, stood at the heart of this tumultuous era. His eyes, fierce and determined, looked out upon his council of ministers, each face reflecting the gravity of their plight. "Our land," he began, his voice steady and resolute, "has always been a land of valour and honour. For centuries, we have fought to protect our people and our traditions. Now, we stand at a crossroads. The Islamic Empire grows ever stronger, its reach extending into our very homes. We must decide our path. Do we accept their dominance and live as subjects under their rule? Or do we rise, once more, to fight for our freedom and our way of life?" The council murmured, voices of wisdom and caution mingling with those of fierce resolve. A wise and loyal minister stepped forward. "Maharana, the path we choose will shape the future of our land. The empire's power is immense, but our spirit is unbreakable. If we choose to fight, we must do so with unity and unwavering courage. The people look to you for leadership, and your resolve will inspire them to stand and fight alongside you." The decision was not one to be taken lightly. It would mean sacrifices, battles, and untold hardships. But it was a choice that would define the legacy of the kingdom and the fate of its people. The princes of other neighbouring states, too, faced similar decisions, each one weighing the cost of submission against the price of resistance. Yet the decision still awaits shall we prepare for war or diplomacy?"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.2.OPT1: "Accept."
 FEE_Western_India_Events.2.OPT2: "Resist."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.3.T: "Depose Incompetence"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.3.D: "In the ancient lands where the Rajput clans held their noble heritage, a unique balance of power existed between these valiant warriors and the ruling crown. The Rajputs, while forever loyal and subordinate to the sovereign they served, were granted special privileges said to be ordained by the gods themselves. One such privilege was the solemn duty of assessing the competency of their rulers. It was believed that the divine will had bestowed upon the Rajputs the authority to determine if the ruling party was capable of bearing the immense responsibilities of the crown. However, this was no trivial matter; it required incontrovertible proof that the current ruler was failing in their duties. The process was rigorous and sacred, ensuring that only those truly unfit for leadership would be deposed. There was one important exception to this power: children. Young rulers, those not yet come of age, were beyond the scrutiny of the Rajput judgement. The law held that a ruler must have reached adulthood and must have reigned for a minimum of five years before they could be evaluated. Only then could the Rajputs invoke their ancient right, to decide if the crown should pass to another, more capable hand. Thus, the Rajputs safeguarded the stability of the realm, ensuring that only the worthy would lead while honouring the divine order that had entrusted them with this grave responsibility. \n\nThe rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been under this exact scrutiny. Now, the time has come. The Rajputs approach [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a solemn purpose written on their very faces. They have invoked their ancient right. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must now abdicate, as is sacred law."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.4.T: "The Bhati Empire"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.4.D: "The royal dynasty of Jaisalmer, proud descendants of the deified hero Krishna, traced their illustrious lineage back to their revered ancestor, Rawal Gaj. Rawal Gaj was not only a formidable leader but also a visionary, believed to have founded the city of Gajni. As the empire expanded, Rawal Gaj's descendant, Rawal Salivahan, rose to prominence. He founded the city of Sialkot and made it his new capital, marking the beginning of a golden era. Salivahan's military prowess was legendary; in 78 CE, he defeated the formidable Saka Scythians at Kahror, earning the title of Saka-ari, or \"foe of the Sakas.\" This victory cemented his reputation as a great warrior and leader. Salivahan's legacy was carried forward by his grandson, Rawal Bhati, who conquered several neighbouring regions. His conquests expanded the empire's influence and solidified the Bhati name in history. It was from Rawal Bhati that the illustrious Bhati clan derived its name, a testament to his indomitable spirit and leadership. The Bhati Empire was renowned for its resilience and strategic acumen. Their rule extended across the rugged terrains and fertile valleys of Afghanistan and northern India, creating a realm that was as culturally rich as it was militarily formidable. The Bhatis built grand forts and palaces, their architecture reflecting both opulence and strength. The people of the Bhati Empire thrived under a governance that balanced justice with mercy, and their society flourished with advancements in arts, trade, and scholarship. Now, as the current rulers reclaim both sides of the Hindu Kush, they evoke the spirit of their ancestors. The legacy of Rawal Gaj, Rawal Salivahan, and Rawal Bhati guides them as they strive to restore the grandeur of the Bhati Empire. With a crown that symbolises their imperial heritage, they seek to revive the golden era, ensuring that the glory of the Bhati name endures for generations to come."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.5.T: "The Battle of Nagaur"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.5.D: "In the year 1455, Feroz Khan, Sultan of Nagaur, passed away. Upon his death, Feroz Khan's elder son, Shams Khan, ascended to the throne. However, his rule was short-lived, as his younger brother, Mujahid Khan, quickly deposed him and sought to take his life. Fearing for his safety, Shams Khan fled to the court of Maharana Kumbha of Mewar, seeking refuge and assistance. Maharana Kumbha, a shrewd and ambitious ruler with longstanding designs on Nagaur, saw this as the perfect opportunity to expand his influence. He welcomed Shams Khan with open arms and agreed to help him reclaim his throne. However, this assistance came with a significant condition: Shams Khan had to acknowledge Maharana Kumbha's supremacy by demolishing a portion of the battlements of the fort of Nagaur, symbolising his submission to Kumbha's authority. Desperate to regain his position, Shams Khan accepted these terms. With the support of Maharana Kumbha, he was reinstated as the ruler of Nagaur, albeit under the shadow of Mewar's dominance. True to his word Maharana Kumbha marched on Nagaur to combat the coup with the entire army of Mewar. Maharana Kumbha proceeded to give Mujahid an ultimatum. To release the throne back to his elder brother or he would take this coup as an act of war."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.6.T: "Reconstruction of the Gop Temple"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.6.D: "Located in the Zinavari Village of Saurashtra, the Gop Temple is one of the oldest surviving stone temples of Gujarat, dedicated to the worship of Lord Surya. Built in a style of architecture resembling the Nagara, the temple bears resemblance to the early Dravidian temples of Aihole and Pattadakal. The Shikhara (spire) of the temple had been constructed with immense intricacy, possessing two gavakshas (horse-shoe arcs) with images of Lord Ganesha sculpted into their walls. However, the temple has withered, its stones eroded over the years due to immense neglect. The idols of Lord Rama and Lakshmana have lost their lustre and the sculptures have been eroded beyond recognition. Perhaps, with the aid of our most capable architects and priests and some bullion, we might be able to restore the holy site to its former glory."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.7.T: "The Unification of Rajputana"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.7.D: "Ever since the Second Battle of Tarain, co-operation between the several disparate Rajput princedoms was considered impossible. However, we have proved that nothing is impossible for the (get dynasty name). From the holiest cities on the Ganges of the East to the Great Thar of the West, we have managed to bring these princes under one unified banner, vanquishing the Sultans who spread terror among the Hindu populace. Where most Kings resort to tyranny and oppression, (get monarch name) has sworn by his sword to defend each and every single one of his subjects, be it Hindu or Musalmaan, to reward loyalty and purge disloyalty, to favor merit over obligations of family and faith. However, the increasing centralization of our realm proves a major challenge. The seemingly unstoppable Sultans of Delhi met their end after their conquests outstretched their administration. Who's to say that the same won't happen to us? Perhaps the time has come to put down the talvaar and to pick up the paper and quill, to introduce widespread administrative reforms, to fund centres of scholarly learning, libraries, gurukuls, the study of the Vedas and Puranas and to patronise the arts instead of allocating our resources to focus on war."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.8.D: "Relations between the Sultanate and the Rajput warrior class could hardly be worse than at the present time. The struggles of our government to maintain order and legitimacy have not gone unnoticed by the ever-restless princes, and their sense of our weakness further inflames the already-existing tension between their predominantly Hindu nobility and our Muslim elite. Their status in our realm has long been guaranteed by a series of compromises, privileges, and implicit understandings made at a time when Islam was newly arrived in the subcontinent. Now, they seek to exploit these arrangements to increase their power to ever greater heights, threatening our own sovereignty. Unless we act against them soon our authority will soon deteriorate beyond our ability to recover."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.9.D: "The Maharaja of Jaipur [Root.Monarch.GetName], this enlightened ruler was not only a sovereign but also a patron of science, mathematics, scholarship, art, architecture, and literature. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] reign was a golden era where intellect and creativity flourished, guided by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] boundless curiosity and profound respect for knowledge. [Root.Monarch.GetName] fascination with the mysteries of the universe led [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to immerse [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the study of mathematics and astronomy. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was well-versed in the ancient wisdom of Indian and Greek mathematics, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] keen intellect was always in search of new insights. Unlike many of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] contemporaries, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was acutely aware of the scientific advancements taking place in Europe. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] kept himself informed about the latest developments, eager to bridge the knowledge of the East and the West. This intellectual bridge found a remarkable expression when [Root.Monarch.GetName] established contact with the Portuguese king. Through this exchange, [Root.Monarch.GetName] compared Portuguese astronomical observations with those of the Indian scholars. With a sense of pride and confidence, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] pointed out that the Indian methods and calculations were superior. This bold assertion was not merely a boast but a testament to the rich and advanced scientific tradition of India, which [Root.Monarch.GetName] was determined to preserve and promote. Under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] patronage, Jaipur became a hub of scientific and cultural activity. [Root.Monarch.GetName] commissioned the construction of Jantar Mantar, a series of monumental astronomical observatories in various cities. These observatories, with their grand instruments and intricate designs, were marvels of architecture and engineering, allowing precise astronomical measurements. Beyond astronomy, [Root.Monarch.GetName] contributions to art and architecture were equally significant. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] founded the city of Jaipur, designing it with a unique blend of traditional Vedic architecture and contemporary urban planning principles. The city, with its broad streets, majestic palaces, and vibrant bazaars, reflected his aesthetic sensibilities and forward-thinking approach. In literature, [Root.Monarch.GetName] supported scholars and poets, fostering a rich cultural milieu where ideas and creativity could thrive.
