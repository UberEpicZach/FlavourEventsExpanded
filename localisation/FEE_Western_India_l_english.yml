 FEE_Western_India_Events.1.T: "Berserker Elephants"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.1.D: "In the heart of Western India, a tradition as ancient as the riding of elephants themselves unfolded on the battlefields. The era of the berserker elephants, a practice both revered and feared, where these majestic beasts were transformed into formidable siege engines. To many, it might have seemed cruel, but in the theatre of war, it was a strategy of immense importance. They would clad their elephants in vast amounts of armour, turning them into nearly indestructible forces of nature. Atop these armoured giants, they erected small wooden or bamboo towers, resembling miniature fortresses. Archers would man these turrets, raining arrows upon the enemy from an elevated vantage point, while the elephants themselves became living siege towers, breaching smaller walls with ease. For grander fortifications, the elephants took on the role of battering rams. With their immense strength and the protection of their armour, they would charge at gates, shattering them and allowing troops to storm through with a height advantage, commanding the battlefield from the backs of their mighty steeds. These siege elephants provided not just a means to break through enemy defences but also a way to control the chaos of gate breaches, maintaining order and momentum in the thick of battle. As time marched on and the advent of gunpowder reshaped warfare, the berserker elephants momentarily fell out of favour. Yet, the innovation did not cease. Ingenious minds soon discovered that these colossal creatures could bear the weight of small cannons on their backs, transforming them once more into critical assets on the battlefield. Towers filled with soldiers wielding rifles replaced the archers, bringing a new era of firepower to the age-old practice. However, the arrival of European powers marked the decline of these extraordinary war elephants. The Europeans, with their own military doctrines and technologies, refused to deploy elephants in such a manner, leading to the eventual disappearance of the berserker elephants from the annals of war."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.2.T: "Accept or Resist?"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.2.D: "In the ancient lands of western India, the sun rose and set upon kingdoms ruled by Hindu princes who held fast to their ancestral thrones. For 700 years, the Islamic Empires of Hindustan had spread its influence, its banners casting long shadows over the fields and palaces of these princely states. The balance of power hung in a delicate dance. As the years turned to centuries, the princes of Western India found themselves embroiled in an unending struggle. Not merely a battle of swords and shields, but a fight to preserve the very essence of their culture and heritage against the tide of a burgeoning Islamic dominance. The empire, with its vast resources and mighty armies, sought to extend its control. But the Hindu princes, proud and unyielding, stood firm, their hearts burning with the desire to maintain their sovereignty and protect their people. In the court of the princely state of [Root.GetName], tensions are running high. The air was thick with the weight of decisions yet to be made, and the echoes of history reverberated through the grand halls. [Root.Monarch.GetName], the valiant warrior king, stood at the heart of this tumultuous era. His eyes, fierce and determined, looked out upon his council of ministers, each face reflecting the gravity of their plight. "Our land," he began, his voice steady and resolute, "has always been a land of valour and honour. For centuries, we have fought to protect our people and our traditions. Now, we stand at a crossroads. The Islamic Empire grows ever stronger, its reach extending into our very homes. We must decide our path. Do we accept their dominance and live as subjects under their rule? Or do we rise, once more, to fight for our freedom and our way of life?" The council murmured, voices of wisdom and caution mingling with those of fierce resolve. A wise and loyal minister stepped forward. "Maharana, the path we choose will shape the future of our land. The empire's power is immense, but our spirit is unbreakable. If we choose to fight, we must do so with unity and unwavering courage. The people look to you for leadership, and your resolve will inspire them to stand and fight alongside you." The decision was not one to be taken lightly. It would mean sacrifices, battles, and untold hardships. But it was a choice that would define the legacy of the kingdom and the fate of its people. The princes of other neighbouring states, too, faced similar decisions, each one weighing the cost of submission against the price of resistance. Yet the decision still awaits shall we prepare for war or diplomacy?"

 FEE_Western_India_Events.3.T: "Depose Incompetence"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.3.D: "In the ancient lands where the Rajput clans held their noble heritage, a unique balance of power existed between these valiant warriors and the ruling crown. The Rajputs, while forever loyal and subordinate to the sovereign they served, were granted special privileges said to be ordained by the gods themselves. One such privilege was the solemn duty of assessing the competency of their rulers. It was believed that the divine will had bestowed upon the Rajputs the authority to determine if the ruling party was capable of bearing the immense responsibilities of the crown. However, this was no trivial matter; it required incontrovertible proof that the current ruler was failing in their duties. The process was rigorous and sacred, ensuring that only those truly unfit for leadership would be deposed. There was one important exception to this power: children. Young rulers, those not yet come of age, were beyond the scrutiny of the Rajput judgement. The law held that a ruler must have reached adulthood and must have reigned for a minimum of five years before they could be evaluated. Only then could the Rajputs invoke their ancient right, to decide if the crown should pass to another, more capable hand. Thus, the Rajputs safeguarded the stability of the realm, ensuring that only the worthy would lead while honouring the divine order that had entrusted them with this grave responsibility. \n\nThe rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been under this exact scrutiny. Now, the time has come. The Rajputs approach [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a solemn purpose written on their very faces. They have invoked their ancient right. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must now abdicate, as is sacred law."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.4.T: "The Bhati Empire"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.4.D: "The royal dynasty of Jaisalmer, proud descendants of the deified hero Krishna, traced their illustrious lineage back to their revered ancestor, Rawal Gaj. Rawal Gaj was not only a formidable leader but also a visionary, believed to have founded the city of Gajni. As the empire expanded, Rawal Gaj's descendant, Rawal Salivahan, rose to prominence. He founded the city of Sialkot and made it his new capital, marking the beginning of a golden era. Salivahan's military prowess was legendary; in 78 CE, he defeated the formidable Saka Scythians at Kahror, earning the title of Saka-ari, or "foe of the Sakas." This victory cemented his reputation as a great warrior and leader. Salivahan's legacy was carried forward by his grandson, Rawal Bhati, who conquered several neighbouring regions. His conquests expanded the empire's influence and solidified the Bhati name in history. It was from Rawal Bhati that the illustrious Bhati clan derived its name, a testament to his indomitable spirit and leadership. The Bhati Empire was renowned for its resilience and strategic acumen. Their rule extended across the rugged terrains and fertile valleys of Afghanistan and northern India, creating a realm that was as culturally rich as it was militarily formidable. The Bhatis built grand forts and palaces, their architecture reflecting both opulence and strength. The people of the Bhati Empire thrived under a governance that balanced justice with mercy, and their society flourished with advancements in arts, trade, and scholarship. Now, as the current rulers reclaim both sides of the Hindu Kush, they evoke the spirit of their ancestors. The legacy of Rawal Gaj, Rawal Salivahan, and Rawal Bhati guides them as they strive to restore the grandeur of the Bhati Empire. With a crown that symbolises their imperial heritage, they seek to revive the golden era, ensuring that the glory of the Bhati name endures for generations to come."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.5.T: "The Khalji Dynasty"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.5.D: "The Khaljis, of Turko-Afghan origin, traced their lineage back to the Turkic people known as the Khalaj. These ancestors migrated alongside the Hunas and Hephthalites from Central Asia into the southern and eastern regions of modern-day Afghanistan as early as 660 CE. There, they ruled the region of Kabul as the Buddhist Turk Shahis, gradually adopting many Afghan customs and traditions over time. The Khaljis' integration into Afghan society was so profound that they were regarded as Afghans by the Turkic nobles of the Delhi Sultanate. This cultural assimilation played a crucial role during the Khalji Revolution, when Jalal-ud-din Khalji ascended to the throne of Delhi. His rise was met with resistance from the Turkic nobles, who viewed him as an outsider due to his Afghan affiliations. Despite this opposition, the Khalji dynasty established itself as a formidable power in Delhi, overthrowing the Mamluk Slave Dynasty. Their rule was marked by significant military conquests and administrative reforms, but it was also fraught with internal strife and challenges to their legitimacy. Eventually, the dynasty was overthrown by the Tughlaq dynasty, and the Khaljis were exiled to the governorship of Malwa. As the Tughlaq dynasty began to deteriorate, the political landscape of India fractured. The Khaljis, along with the sultans of Gujarat, Jaunpur, Bengal, and the Bahmanis, declared their independence. Though they were now rulers of a smaller dominion, the Khaljis never forgot their origins as the original Delhi imperial dynasty that had overthrown the Mamluks. In Malwa, the Khalji rulers kept the flame of their imperial aspirations alive. They vowed to one day reclaim their lost imperial seat and crown in the Red City of Delhi. This ambition became a defining feature of their rule, driving their political and military strategies as they sought to restore their former glory."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.9.T: "Desert Diplomacy"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.9.D: "The desert is often a desolate and morbid place, but it can also be a stunningly beautiful landscape, especially during sunrise, sunset, and under the night sky. The amazing colours of the sky, contrasted with the warm glow of the sand, create an almost magical scene. As the sun dips below the horizon, the sand shimmers golden, and the sky bursts into a spectacular display of reds, pinks, and purples. Sitting in this sea of gold, watching the sun's descent, is a sight like no other. As night falls, the brief darkness reveals a vast black void adorned with thousands of stars that shimmer like diamonds against a black velvet cloth. It is in this enchanting setting that we welcome our esteemed visitors, foreign dignitaries, and rulers. Under the fading light of the setting sun, a richly set table offers the most royal of foods, inviting guests to indulge in a feast fit for kings. As the stars begin to twinkle, the meal transitions to hot coffee or spiced tea, sipped under the starlit sky. This tradition has left even the most extravagant of emperors in awe. The combination of the desert's natural beauty and our warm hospitality creates an unforgettable experience, one that lingers in the hearts of all who witness it."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.10.T: "The Rathore Rajputs"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.10.D: "The Rathore Rajputs, renowned for their valor and military prowess, instituted a national martial code that mandated every man to fulfil his military duty. However, this decree extended far beyond mere obligation; it ignited a cultural obsession with martial excellence. The Rathores established a lasting legacy by embedding a profound focus on martial education within their society, cultivating a relentless drive to enhance their military capabilities with great fervour. From a young age, Rathore Rajputs were trained in the arts of war. Their education was not limited to the physical aspects of combat but also included strategy, leadership, and the warrior's code of honour. Swordsmanship, archery, and horse riding became second nature to them, as they were groomed to be formidable warriors. This rigorous training ensured that every Rathore man was prepared to defend his homeland and uphold the honour of his dynasty. The Rathores' dedication to military excellence was evident in their impressive array of forts and strongholds, strategically placed to defend their territory. These architectural marvels were both functional and symbolic, representing the strength and resilience of the Rathore clan. Their armies were renowned for their discipline, skill, and indomitable spirit, often emerging victorious against formidable adversaries. This martial culture permeated every aspect of Rathore Principality, fostering a sense of unity and purpose. Festivals and ceremonies celebrated military achievements, and tales of heroic battles and warriors were passed down through generations, inspiring future soldiers. The Rathores' relentless pursuit of military superiority ensured their place in history as one of the most formidable Rajput dynasties of their time. Now that we have fully integrated the lands of the Rathores, and our Rulers have seen their full potential, we have started to integrate these Rajputs in our own army. While we have been at odds in the past the dust of war and conflict has now settled and we have earned their respect. The military prowess of our ruler has made them see sense and they now fully submit to our king. They will serve as our most loyal and professional Rajput soldiers."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.11.T: "The Battle of Nagaur"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.11.D: "In the year 1455, Feroz Khan, Sultan of Nagaur, passed away. Upon his death, Feroz Khan's elder son, Shams Khan, ascended to the throne. However, his rule was short-lived, as his younger brother, Mujahid Khan, quickly deposed him and sought to take his life. Fearing for his safety, Shams Khan fled to the court of Maharana Kumbha of Mewar, seeking refuge and assistance. Maharana Kumbha, a shrewd and ambitious ruler with longstanding designs on Nagaur, saw this as the perfect opportunity to expand his influence. He welcomed Shams Khan with open arms and agreed to help him reclaim his throne. However, this assistance came with a significant condition: Shams Khan had to acknowledge Maharana Kumbha's supremacy by demolishing a portion of the battlements of the fort of Nagaur, symbolising his submission to Kumbha's authority. Desperate to regain his position, Shams Khan accepted these terms. With the support of Maharana Kumbha, he was reinstated as the ruler of Nagaur, albeit under the shadow of Mewar's dominance. True to his word Maharana Kumbha marched on Nagaur to combat the coup with the entire army of Mewar. Maharana Kumbha proceeded to give Mujahid an ultimatum. To release the throne back to his elder brother or he would take this coup as an act of war."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.12.T: "The Siege of Chittorgarh"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.12.D: "On the first day of the Kartika, 1489 (23rd October, 1567), Mughal batteries opened fire upon the mighty fortress of Chittorgarh. Akbar, the Mughal Emperor, considered the fort of Chittor a thorn in his side, hindering further expansion in the Deccan. To add to his frustration, the Maharana, Udai Singh II, provided refuge to the Afghan rebel leader Baz Bahadur. The Sisodia treasury had been exhausted following a long war with Gujarat and sustaining a prolonged war with the grand Mughal Army seemed impossible. Heeding the advice of the Royal Council, the Maharana and his family fled towards the city of Udaipur, leaving the fort with a garrison of 8,000 troops under the leadership of Jaimal Rathore and Fateh Singh. Emperor Akbar further incited religious fervour, calling for all Muslims to join the 'Jihad' against the 'infidels'.\n\nDespite being severely outnumbered, the besieged Rajputs fought like tigers. Every attempt the Mughals made to tear down the walls of the fortress and assault its defenders bore no fruit. Any breaches were subsequently repaired overnight, much to the dismay of the Mughal Commanders. The mighty Jalalluddin himself evaded death by a hair's margin. After reinforcement of cannons were brought from all over the Empire, did the Mughals finally succeed in a coordinated assault on the fort. While aiding with the repairs, Jaimal Rathore was mortally wounded from a musket shot by the Shahenshah-e-Hind. As the Ghazi's troops fought their way into the heart of the bastion, they realised that their sheer numbers were matched only by the stubbornness of the Mewari soldiers. On the auspicious day of Holi, the few remaining saffron-clad warriors under the leadership of the young Fateh Singh fought bravely, albeit in vain to defend the final inches of the fort. Horrified by their inevitable fate, Rajput women, young, old and infant, in their silver ghagras stepped into pyres, creating an almost beautiful scene of devastation and hopelessness.\n\nThe five month long siege had ended, with the fort's entire garrison slain. Its once bustling streets had been reduced to rubble and corpses lined every corner. The Conquest of Chittor, even though extremely costly in terms of both money and manpower, allowed the Mughals to easily expand into the remaining territories of the Sisodias. Sticking true to their nature however, many Rajputs rallied to the war of resistance led by Maharana Pratap. While they would be martyred in the attempt, their valour would inspire opposition to Mughal rule for generations to come."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.13.D: "Located in the Zinavari Village of Saurashtra, the Gop Temple is one of the oldest surviving stone temples of Gujarat, dedicated to the worship of Lord Surya. Built in a style of architecture resembling the Nagara, the temple bears resemblance to the early Dravidian temples of Aihole and Pattadakal. The Shikhara (spire) of the temple had been constructed with immense intricacy, possessing two gavakshas (horse-shoe arcs) with images of Lord Ganesha sculpted into their walls. However, the temple has withered, its stones eroded over the years due to immense neglect. The idols of Lord Rama and Lakshmana have lost their lustre and the sculptures have been eroded beyond recognition. Perhaps, with the aid of our most capable architects and priests and some bullion, we might be able to restore the holy site to its former glory."

Who's to say that the same won't happen to us?
