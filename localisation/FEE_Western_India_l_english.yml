 FEE_Western_India_Events.1.T: "Berserker Elephants"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.1.D: "In the heart of Western India, a tradition as ancient as the riding of elephants themselves unfolded on the battlefields. The era of the berserker elephants, a practice both revered and feared, where these majestic beasts were transformed into formidable siege engines. To many, it might have seemed cruel, but in the theatre of war, it was a strategy of immense importance. They would clad their elephants in vast amounts of armour, turning them into nearly indestructible forces of nature. Atop these armoured giants, they erected small wooden or bamboo towers, resembling miniature fortresses. Archers would man these turrets, raining arrows upon the enemy from an elevated vantage point, while the elephants themselves became living siege towers, breaching smaller walls with ease. For grander fortifications, the elephants took on the role of battering rams. With their immense strength and the protection of their armour, they would charge at gates, shattering them and allowing troops to storm through with a height advantage, commanding the battlefield from the backs of their mighty steeds. These siege elephants provided not just a means to break through enemy defences but also a way to control the chaos of gate breaches, maintaining order and momentum in the thick of battle. As time marched on and the advent of gunpowder reshaped warfare, the berserker elephants momentarily fell out of favour. Yet, the innovation did not cease. Ingenious minds soon discovered that these colossal creatures could bear the weight of small cannons on their backs, transforming them once more into critical assets on the battlefield. Towers filled with soldiers wielding rifles replaced the archers, bringing a new era of firepower to the age-old practice. However, the arrival of European powers marked the decline of these extraordinary war elephants. The Europeans, with their own military doctrines and technologies, refused to deploy elephants in such a manner, leading to the eventual disappearance of the berserker elephants from the annals of war."

 FEE_Western_India_Events.2.T: "Accept or Resist?"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.2.D: "In the ancient lands of western India, the sun rose and set upon kingdoms ruled by Hindu princes who held fast to their ancestral thrones. For 700 years, the Islamic Empires of Hindustan had spread its influence, its banners casting long shadows over the fields and palaces of these princely states. The balance of power hung in a delicate dance. As the years turned to centuries, the princes of Western India found themselves embroiled in an unending struggle. Not merely a battle of swords and shields, but a fight to preserve the very essence of their culture and heritage against the tide of a burgeoning Islamic dominance. The empire, with its vast resources and mighty armies, sought to extend its control. But the Hindu princes, proud and unyielding, stood firm, their hearts burning with the desire to maintain their sovereignty and protect their people. In the court of the princely state of [Root.GetName], tensions are running high. The air was thick with the weight of decisions yet to be made, and the echoes of history reverberated through the grand halls. [Root.Monarch.GetName], the valiant warrior king, stood at the heart of this tumultuous era. His eyes, fierce and determined, looked out upon his council of ministers, each face reflecting the gravity of their plight. "Our land," he began, his voice steady and resolute, "has always been a land of valour and honour. For centuries, we have fought to protect our people and our traditions. Now, we stand at a crossroads. The Islamic Empire grows ever stronger, its reach extending into our very homes. We must decide our path. Do we accept their dominance and live as subjects under their rule? Or do we rise, once more, to fight for our freedom and our way of life?" The council murmured, voices of wisdom and caution mingling with those of fierce resolve. A wise and loyal minister stepped forward. "Maharana, the path we choose will shape the future of our land. The empire's power is immense, but our spirit is unbreakable. If we choose to fight, we must do so with unity and unwavering courage. The people look to you for leadership, and your resolve will inspire them to stand and fight alongside you." The decision was not one to be taken lightly. It would mean sacrifices, battles, and untold hardships. But it was a choice that would define the legacy of the kingdom and the fate of its people. The princes of other neighbouring states, too, faced similar decisions, each one weighing the cost of submission against the price of resistance. Yet the decision still awaits shall we prepare for war or diplomacy?"

 FEE_Western_India_Events.3.T: "Depose Incompetence"
 FEE_Western_India_Events.3.D: "In the ancient lands where the Rajput clans held their noble heritage, a unique balance of power existed between these valiant warriors and the ruling crown. The Rajputs, while forever loyal and subordinate to the sovereign they served, were granted special privileges said to be ordained by the gods themselves. One such privilege was the solemn duty of assessing the competency of their rulers. It was believed that the divine will had bestowed upon the Rajputs the authority to determine if the ruling party was capable of bearing the immense responsibilities of the crown. However, this was no trivial matter; it required incontrovertible proof that the current ruler was failing in their duties. The process was rigorous and sacred, ensuring that only those truly unfit for leadership would be deposed. There was one important exception to this power: children. Young rulers, those not yet come of age, were beyond the scrutiny of the Rajput judgement. The law held that a ruler must have reached adulthood and must have reigned for a minimum of five years before they could be evaluated. Only then could the Rajputs invoke their ancient right, to decide if the crown should pass to another, more capable hand. Thus, the Rajputs safeguarded the stability of the realm, ensuring that only the worthy would lead while honouring the divine order that had entrusted them with this grave responsibility. \n\nThe rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been under this exact scrutiny. Now, the time has come. The Rajputs approach [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a solemn purpose written on their very faces. They have invoked their ancient right. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must now abdicate, as is sacred law."
