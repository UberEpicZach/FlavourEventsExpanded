 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.T: "The Renaissance in Scotland"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.D: "While the Renaissance is in full swing in far-off Italy, under the blessed leadership of [SCO.Monarch.GetName], education and culture have flowered in Scotland at long last. The University of St. Andrews, one of the oldest such institutions in the British Isles, had already been founded in 1413, with the University of Glasgow and University of St. Andrew's following in 1450 and 1495. The pinnacle of this flowering came in 1496 with the Education Act of 1496, when Scotland became the first nation in the world to institute compulsory education (of landowners), for the purposes of fostering a more equitable justice system in Scotland."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.OPT1: "Pass the Education Act!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.OPT2: "Fund the Universities, but do not anger the Lords of Scotland"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.1.OPT3: "We don't need these dangerous new Italian ideas!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.2.T: "A Strategic Marriage"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.2.D: "With the rise of the Tudors in England and the Hundred Years' War drawing to a slow and painful close, Scotland stands at a crossroads. The English, ever seeking to expand into Scottish holdings, are a historic and existential threat, but currently exhausted from years of foreign engagements and civil wars, and are perhaps, for the first time in history, open to rapprochement with their northern neighbour. Meanwhile, France is the historic ally of Scotland, but with the English largely evicted from Europe, their interest in helping Scotland might well wane beyond repair if swift diplomatic action is not taken. The time has come for Scotland to solidify her diplomatic standing in Europe, but no longer can she dally between France in England: we must choose a side! And with several eligible daughters of House [SCO.Dynasty.GetName], a royal marriage could well seal whichever bond we pursue."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.2.OPT1: "Marriage with France"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.2.OPT2: "Marriage with England"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.2.OPT2.tooltip1: "Removes all §Y[ENG.GetAdjective]§! claims to §Y[SCO.GetAdjective]§! lands."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.3.T: "Marriage Offer Spurned"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.3.D: "With the great displeasure we have been informed that our marriage proposal for Scotland was somehow spurned. If these Scottish dogs think they can just simply say \"no\" to us then they are even more stupid than we thought. But from such a situation another possibility emerges - we could use the wole confusion and simply press our claim to the Scottish throne by using pure force."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.3.OPT1: "They shall taste our swords!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.4.T: "Treaty of Perpetual Peace"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.4.D: "Sometimes, on a very rare occasion diplomacy indeed turns out to be stronger than the sword. By the grace of our Lord and Saviour, Scottish lords have come to their senses and finally noticed an other way to handle our tense situation. Instead conducting another pointless assault and fighting never ending skirmishes, they decided to offer us a deal - by terms of which our countries could amend mutual relationships."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.4.OPT1: "This might be the beginning of our reconciliation!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.5.T: "[SCO.Monarch.GetName] Visits the Highlands"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.5.D: "In 1494, James IV of Scotland, one of the few late Scottish kings to learn Gaelic, made a series of visits to the Highlands after reconciling with the power of the Lordship of the Isles and the Douglass clan. Not only was such a visit almost unheard of for Scottish kings, but James decided that coming as a friend to the clans rather than as an assertive overlord would prove more productive, and this was indeed the case. After many royal feasts and hunts with the various great clan chieftains of the North, we must now decide - shall we attempt to divert the clans from constant petty warfare via economic projects? Or are we to placate the chiefs in exchange for loyalty?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.5.OPT1: "Let us impose order on these wild northerners!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.5.OPT2: "Let us continue to befriend the clans"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.6.T: "Naval Expansion and the Great Michael"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.6.D: "In the aftermath of the fall of Constantinople, [SCO.Monarch.GetName], having settled internal conflicts and achieved peace, however uneasy, with England, has become filled with religious zeal, and the desire to use Scotland's position as the balance decider in European alliances to form a new crusade, one that would unite Christendom against the Turkish menace. However, to do so, a great fleet will first be needed to get to the Levant in the first place..."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.6.OPT1: "Build a Grand Fleet!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.6.OPT1.tooltip1: "All rivals of §Y[TUR.GetName]§! will get §G+100§! opinion modifier towards §Y[SCO.GetName]§!."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.6.OPT2: "We do not have the resources for a fleet with England at our doorstep!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.T: "Disaster at Flodden"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.D: "In 1513, as a result of the renewal of the Auld Alliance with France, the insolent English monarch Henry VIII rebuffed James IV's attempts to secure peace in the British Isles, declaring himself the \"verie owner of Scotland\", bringing yet another Anglo-Scottish War to the island. The Scottish army, ill-equipped and badly led, managed to capture English border forts before being caught at Flodden. The battle was in name only, as it quickly became a massacre: the flower of the Scottish nobility, the knights of Scotland, were slaughtered almost to a man, and the Royal Scottish army for a time ceased to exist as a credible fighting force. The battle is remembered today in the Scottish eulogy song which laments: The Flowers of the Forest are a'wede away."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.OPT1: "O God, why hast thou forsaken Scotland?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.OPT1.TT: "Propose Peace?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.7.OPT2: "We shall never surrender!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.8.T: "Corruption in the Church"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.8.D: "As Protestant views gain steam on the continent, nowhere in Europe is the Catholic Church as corrupt as the Church in Scotland. “Pilates, not Prelates,” Pope Eugenius IV had described Scottish bishops. Priests are regularly ordained who cannot even read or write, while many others are openly drunk or lecherous, while still others use their positions to increase their own luxurious dwellings (which more often than not are fought over by bastard sons after the death of the priest), while rural church buildings fall into disrepair."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.8.OPT1: "Root out the Rot!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.8.OPT2: "The situation is not without it's advantages..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.9.T: "Early Scottish Reformers"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.9.D: "With the arrival of preachers Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart, the Reformation has arrived in Scotland. Bringing revolutionary Protestant ideas to a nation weary of corruption in the church, their words spread like wildfire. Ever-larger crowds, including some of noble stock, follow them wherever they go, and seditious whispers against the Roman church are not so quiet anymore..."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.9.OPT1: "Burn the heretics!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.9.OPT2: "Have these traitorous dogs killed secretly"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.9.OPT3: "Let us hear what these new preachers have to say..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.10.T: "Martyrdom of Patrick Hamilton"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.10.D: "Rather than seek reconciliation, the Scottish monarch, [SCO.Monarch.GetName], egged on by the Catholic cardinals, has decided to make a public example of the Protestant preacher Patrick Hamilton in order to quell the sedition caused by his words. However, attempting intimidating Scots has rarely proven successful, and the courage at which Hamilton met his death only inspired more people to follow his ideas and those of other reformers. One observer remarked to the presiding Cardinal \"My Lord, if you burn any more, let them be burned in cellars, for the reek of Patrick Hamiltion has infected as many as it blew upon.\""
 FEE_Scotland_Events.10.OPT1: "Only time will tell what comes of this..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.11.T: "John Knox"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.11.D: "Having already been involved as the right-hand man of George Wishart, an early Scottish reformers, former Catholic priest John Knox was banished after the initial suppression of the reformers' message led to his leading a daring assault on the Cardinal's castle by protestant zealots, during which the Cardinal was killed. \n\nCondemned as a rower on a French galley, a fate which normally would prove fatal. While physically weakened and no longer able to wield a great Scottish two-handed sword as he did under Wishart, Knox's already formidable personality was only honed by his experience aboard the galleys. \n\nHaving spent several years under the strict tutelage of John Calvin in Geneva, Knox adopted a rare but potent strain of Protestantism, and returned to Scotland determined to bring that faith to his homeland."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.11.OPT1: "What could this mean for Scotland?"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.12.T: "The Lords of the Congregation"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.12.D: "While the bold new ideas brought by the flaming personality of Knox have not officially been accepted, many of the Scottish nobles, whether through genuine belief, disgust at the corruption of the clergy, or simply a desire to reduce royal power, have secretly formed a pact, calling themselves of Lords of the Congregation. Their seditious spirit was fueled by Calvin's and Knox's radical interpretation of Scripture, which gave license to and indeed encouraged \"lesser magistrates\" to rise up and install a more \"godly\" ruler."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.12.OPT1: "How dare they?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.12.OPT1.tooltip1: "Other §YReformed§! countries might see an opportunity in supporting the rebels..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.13.T: "Brothers in Arms?"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.13.D: "The news have arrived that in the distant land of Scotland our brothers and sisters in faith have taken up their arms and trying to impose rightful way of interpreting the very words of our Lord and Saviour upon their ungodly ruler! Perhaps by providing them enough help both in terms of gold and willing to fight souls we would turn the tide of such a godly conflict towards the victory of true believers? Yet, doing so would also gravely infuriate [SCO.Monarch.GetName] of [SCO.GetName]."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.13.OPT1: "Oh yes, of course, everything for faith! Let God sort his own!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.13.OPT2: "Or perhaps not. Better leave it be..."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.14.T: "[From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] Supports Rebellion!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.14.D: "An enemy force from abroad has supported the rebellious zealots that have ravaged our country. Such a clearly hostile interference in our nation will not go unnoticed.\nLet [From.Monarch.GetName], the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] know of this offense!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.14.OPT1: "Damn thou shall be!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.15.T: "[From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] Refuses to Support Rebellion!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.15.D: "A force from abroad has refused to support the rebellious zealots that have ravaged our country. Such a clearly friendly act will not go unnoticed.\nLet [From.Monarch.GetName], the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] know of our gratitude!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.15.OPT1: "Wonderfully!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.16.T: "Reimposition of Church Hierarchy"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.16.D: "After successive waves of reformers had taken control of the church largely out of both royal and papal hands, the Stuart kings often sought ways to reign in the autonomy of both the church and the nobles who ran it. Taking a page from Scotland's southern neighbor, [SCO.Monarch.GetName] has come up with an ambitious plan of enforcing a common book of prayer (approved by the crown of course), and generally bringing the church, and the nobles who back the church, back undernational control.\n\nOne of the greatest obstacles to [SCO.Monarch.GetName]'s plan, and to central authority in general, is the rigorously Presbyterian structure of the church instituted by Knox. In this structure, churches are governed by an assembly of the elders of each congregation, who in turn comprise the General Assembly, with no central figurehead or hierarchy. For [SCO.Monarch.GetName]'s plan to make any progress, he must first reinstitute a more traditional hierarchy of bishops, beholden to the crown."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.16.OPT1: "Crack down on the Presbyterians"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.16.OPT2: "Make Concessions to the Presbyterians"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.17.T: "Jenny Geddes and the Prayer Book Riots"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.17.D: "The imposition of a uniform prayer book and the re-introduction of pipe organs - derisively called a “kist o'whistles” by Scots - to Scottish churches was meant merely as a benign first stepin [SCO.Monarch.GetName]'s plans. However, the mere suggestion of “popery” was met with resistance fierce enough to completely catch [SCO.Monarch.GetName] completely off guard. Churches all over Scotland bristled with the changes, and it only took a spark to light them.\n\nThat spark came from Edinburgh itself, the historic heart of the Scottish church. When the new prayer book was first read, one Jenny Geddes, a local young woman, was the first to stand. \"De'il gie you colic, the wame o' ye, fause thief; daur ye say Mass in my lug?\" she yelled. Picking up a humble stool, universally used by congregation members in church's largely barren of seating, Geddes hurled the stool directly at the offending preacher. Within minutes, the entire city was up in arms, and the tumult quickly spread throughout Scotland."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.17.OPT1: "Back down, and quickly!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.17.OPT2: "The Presbyterians will bend, or be destroyed!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.18.T: "Signing of the National Covenant"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.18.D: "The revolt of the Presbyterians has once again brought the Lords of the Congregation, never far from the public eye, to the forefront of Scottish politics again. Now, however, fearing the threat of royal absolutism, even more nobles have joined their ranks. Together with notable Presbyterian ministers, representatives from the burghers, and several minor gentry, they have drafted a landmark document, the National Covenant.\n\nThe Covenanters, as they became known, pledged their loyalty both to “the true religion” and to royal authority, but only within limits far below those of European absolutist monarchs. Copies of the Covenant were swiftly carried from Edinburgh throughout all Scotland.\n\nEven more alarming, Scotland's greatest military leaders, including Archibald Campbell, a Highland Chieftain, and Alexander Leslie, a distinguished veteran of the War of the Protestant League on the continent."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.18.OPT1: "Back down"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.18.OPT2: "Negotiate with the Covenanters"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.18.OPT3: "Crush Them!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.18.OPT3.tooltip1: "It will tear up [SCO.GetName]. Highland provinces of Covenanters will break off from the state and declare independence war against us.\n\nIt's highly probable that our rivals join in at the Convenanters' side!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.19.T: "Scottish Civil War"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.19.D: "War! Tensions between Crown and Covenant have reached a boiling point. Under the leadership of Leslie and Campbell, the Covenanters have had enough, declaring their own independence from the Kingdom of Scotland!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.19.OPT1: "For the Crown!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.19.OPT1.tooltip1: "You have to conquer §Yall§! Covenanters provinces.\nOtherwise they will stay free and thus be viewed as the victors of the Civil War."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.19.OPT2: "For the Covenanters!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.20.T: "Covenanters Rise up Against Oppressors!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.20.D: "War! Tensions between Crown and Covenant have reached a boiling point. Under the leadership of Leslie and Campbell, the Covenanters have had enough, declaring their own independence from our rival, the Kingdom of Scotland!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.25.T: "Incident at Glencoe"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.25.D: "Following the civil war that tore Scotland apart, the victors now seek to disarm the unruly Highlands that provide a disproportionate source of ready levies for revolts due to a densely populated and well-armed warrior culture. Royal troops dispatched to Glencoe to keep the peace suspect that the MacDonald clan there might yet be plotting rebellion."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.25.OPT1: "Try to Ascertain the Truth"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.25.OPT2: "Massacre Them!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.26.T: "The Darien Scheme"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.26.D: "Scotland looks enviously at the vast colonial holdings of the Catholic empires of Spain and Portugal. To gain Scotland a colonial foothold at a key location in the New World, an ambitious merchant has lobbied endless for a daring project aimed at Darien on the Panama isthmus. To catch up with the head start of the Spanish, a concerted effort to transport many colonists at once, rather than colonize piecemeal, is the only option (at least that's what everyone believes). Naturally the investment involved would be substantial, but the potential payoff may well be enormous."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.26.OPT1: "Fund the Project"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.26.OPT2: "Don't Take that Risk"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.27.T: "Darien Success"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.27.D: "It worked! Thanks be to God for the fortunate weather, helpful natives, and hard work of the intrepid colonists of Darien. Due to them, Scotland finally has a foothold in the lucrative trade of South America."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.27.OPT1: "Wonderfully!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.27.OPT1.tooltip1: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gets a new land in §Y[This.Location.GetName]§!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.28.T: "Disaster at Darien"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.28.D: "Woe be to Scotland! The colonists, beset by poor weather, hostile Spanish raids, and poor coordination, have vanished almost to a man, with the few pitiful survivors taken as slaves by the Spanish. The loss is not just to our national treasury and the brave souls who died; this is also a great blow to our national pride, and the people of Scotland, shocked by this disaster, have started to wonder if God is indeed with our nation."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.28.OPT1: "How is this possible?"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.29.T: "The Highland Clearances"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.29.D: "With the coming of globalized trade and improved infrastructure also comes a decline, at long last, of the pre-feudal clan system which has ruled in the Highlands for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Eager to keep up with their Lowland counterparts, Highland clan leaders are fast shifting their emphasis from the upkeep of armed retinues to economic gain. Most lucrative in the Highlands is the mass raising and export of sheep. This understandably takes much of the land formerly used by crofters to live on, evicting many and causing them to seek employment in the more developed Lowlands."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.29.OPT1: "Encourage the Clearances"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.29.OPT2: "Protect the Ancient Land Rights of the Crofters"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.30.T: "Glasgow Tobacco Markets"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.30.D: "With the increase in trade from the New World comes many economic opportunities, both for Scots who move abroad and for those who stay home. Recently, the smoking of tobacco has become all the rage in Europe, and Scotland's privileged position with access to the American colonies which provide the weed has fostered a prosperous trade. In Glasgow in particular, a thriving sector of trade has arisen, leading to a new class of wealthy businessmen known as “tobacco lairds.” Known by their bright red clothing (some say to hide the stains of tobacco juice), these capitalist barons could definitely help our economy grow."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.30.OPT1: "Let us encourage these new men!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.30.OPT2: "A custome lothseome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the Lungs! We shall not encourage this!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.31.T: "Scottish Enlightenment"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.31.D: "While the focus on the continent is on the new wave of French and German thinkers, Scotland in the 18th century is experiencing a new age of cultural, intellectual, and scientific flowering of its own. In Scotland, however, there is much less focus on abstract and philosophical questions and pure reason and a more solid foundation of empiricism and a search for practical benefits to society. After all, who really cares how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? The strong network of universities, clubs, printing houses, libraries, museums, and societies that had grown up over centuries have already helped create a vibrant intellectual culture unmatched anywhere in the world. Royal patronage, however, would definitely be welcomed in solidifying Scotland's position as intellectual capital of the world."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.31.OPT1: "Found a Royal Society!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.31.OPT2: "Give assistance to the existing societies"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.31.OPT3: "The Crown should not be involved – best to let the societies do their work"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.32.T: "Adam Smith and the Wealth of Nations"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.32.D: "\"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.\" Such is the book that has recently appeared in bookmarkets throughout Scotland, and the ideas espoused there in are spreading like wildfire. The author, Adam Smith, has introduced the concept of the \"invisible hand\", the process by which free market economies control themselves and lead to prosperity through health competition. While not the first to espouse capitalism, Smith would come to be its intellectual champion, framing it in a coherent theory of economics for the first time. His advocacy for a restriction of government control over the economy, while potentially a boon for the Scottish people, runs counter to much of what has traditionally been accepted in the royal court."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.32.OPT1: "Let us embrace the free market!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.32.OPT2: "Invisible Hand? Ha! My own hands can run this economy, thank you very much"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.33.T: "James Watt"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.33.D: "While steam engines in various forms have been cropping up throughout Europe in this new age of gadgets, it is in Scotland that the true breakthrough in engineering has occurred. James Watt, a relatively unknown tinkerer from Glasgow, has realized that current steam engines waste a good deal of energy and has invented a \"separate condenser\", which vastly increases the efficiency. This invention would come to revolutionize industry by making the steam engine into the workhorse of the Industrial Revolution, making mass production of coal and cloth more possible than ever before!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.33.OPT1: "Oh, this is great!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.34.T: "Encyclopedia Britannica"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.34.D: "An answer to French philosophe's abstract and philosophy-focused work, the first \"Encyclopedia\", a group of academics in Edinburgh have decided to produce a more practical and universal Encyclopedia, the Encyclopedia Brittanica, as a summation of all of human knowledge. This work will serve to spread accumulated knowledge to the masses, help establish a more uniform knowledge base for a more productive society, and (as a side benefit, of course), spread Scotland's culture influence around the world."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.34.OPT1: "Support the Encyclopedia"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.34.OPT2: "Don't Support it"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.35.T: "The Celtic Revival Movement"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.35.D: "While Scotland is ever looking to the future, making strides in economics, education, technology, and science, there is also a yearning to rediscover Scotland's ancient roots. As a result, the eighteenth century saw a \"Scottish Renaissance\", a period of great flowering of romantic literature featuring the Scotland of old. Notable authors included Sir Walter Scott, Macpherson (author of the apocryphal Celtic epic \"Ossian\"), and poet Robert \"Robbie\" Burns. Their works helped spark a revival in Scottish national pride and dignity, and the desire to maintain Scotland's unique culture in the midst of great social change. Additionally, they rehabilitated the image of Scotland. No longer seen as uncouth northern barbarians, the people of Europe now see the Scots for who they were all along: fearless, hospitable, chivalrous, and virtouos."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.35.OPT1: "Glory to our Celtic ancestors! Let us support this noble endeavor!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.35.OPT2: "How interesting"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.35.OPT3: "Pah! We look to the future, not the past!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.36.T: "Scotland and Modern Warfare"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.36.D: "For centuries, Scotland has relied on its tried and true tactics to win in wars. Known as “devilsin skirts” by their enemies, Scotland has a reputation unmatched in the world for the ferocity and courage of her soldiers. In the rapidly changing modern era, however, some military theorists suggest that the prowess of the individual soldier will soon become irrelevant in a war decided by industrial might. Our men may not like it, but they may have to learn to fight as a single machine-like unit rather than as courageous Highland warriors to win wars."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.36.OPT1: "We cannot abandon the heritage that has served us so well!"

 FEE_Scotland_Events.37.T: "The Education Act of $YEAR$"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.37.D: "The Education Act was a law passed by the Scottish Parliament in 1496, that required the oldest sons of every landowner to attend school to study Latin, arts and law. This was intended to improve the administration of justice across the country, by making sure local authorities understood the Scottish legal code. \nThe law text described requirements for advancing from one part of the education to another, and was in that sense an early standardised curriculum. The law was the first case of compulsory education in Scotland, and remained in force until the 19th century."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.37.OPT1: "Every landowner should understand our laws."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.37.OPT2: "Education should focus on the military."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.38.T: "Anti-French Sentiment"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.38.D: "Despite the great benefit of our Auld Alliance, the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ people of Scotland are worried about our cooperation with the French, one of the fiercest opponents of the reformation in Europe.

 FEE_Scotland_Events.38.OPT1: "Our alliance stands for a reason! The peasants can go back to their hovels and pray."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.38.OPT2: "It is time to let France know how important our faith is to us."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.39.T: "The Claim of Right"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.39.D: "In 1689, shortly after the Glorious Revolution, the Scottish Parliament passed the Claim of Right Act. The law deposed the former King James who had already been forced to cede the English throne in favour of King William III, maintaining the union of the two crowns. \nHowever, the act also expanded the power of the Scottish parliament, and ensured that any monarch of Scotland would have to accept these documents in order to legally hold the throne. If we were to force such a document upon our overlord, we could weaken their influence while retaining peace."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.39.OPT1: "It is better if we comply with our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s wishes."

 FEE_Scotland_Events.40.D: "The Scottish parliament has taken the opportunity of a change of rulers to pass laws that require any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to acknowledge the Scottish Parliament if they are to be seen as lawful. This leaves their Parliament in charge of many royal matters, while balancing the monarch's rights with obligations to the country. \n\nWhile this is seems utterly unacceptable, if we were to accept the laws, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] would be the legal ruler of Scotland in every sense."
 FEE_Scotland_Events.40.OPT1: "I will tear their constitution to shreds!"
 FEE_Scotland_Events.40.OPT2: "They can do what they want, as long as they know who truly is their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
