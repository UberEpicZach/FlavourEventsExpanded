 hee_KOR.1.t:0 "Establishing Hangul"
 hee_KOR.1.d:0 "Hangul is the Korean alphabet created in 1443 and promulgated in the 1446 work \"Huminjeongeum\", or \"The Proper Sounds For the Instruction of the People.\"\n\nSponsored by Sejong the Great and probably created by the Hall of Worthies, the new script was meant as a replacement for the Chinese characters used in Korea at the time, which was inefficient for expressing the Korean language. They were made easy, so that even a commoner could learn to read and write them. \"A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over. A stupid man in the space of ten days.\"\n\nThis would eventually lead to such a high literacy rate among those of lower birth that a paranoid king banned the use of Hangul in 1504. However, use did not stop entirely, and in the late 16th century Hangul saw a revival and quickly became the dominant alphabet in Korea."
 hee_KOR.1.a:0 "Our nation needs an alphabet more fit for our tongue."
 hee_KOR.2.t:0 "Sejo Attempts to Usurp the Throne!"
 hee_KOR.2.d:0 "King Danjong rose to the throne when he was merely twelve, and would only rule for two years. His uncle, and brother of the former king, Sejo, usurped his throne and seized the kingdom for himself. After a failed assassination attempt by ministers loyal to Danjong, Sejo had them and the former king killed.\n\nDespite his ruthlessness, or possibly because of his unstoppable daring, he was a successful ruler, centralising the country and encouraging the publication of books on history, economics and religion. He was also a great military strategist, and attacked the Jurchen tribes of the north multiple times. \n\nMost famously, in 1468 he established the first form of constitutional law in Korea, the Grand Code for State Administration."
 hee_KOR.2.a:0 "We need a stronger king than this child!"
 hee_KOR.2.b:0 "Send Seju into exile and keep the king safe!"
 hee_KOR.3.t:0 "Forest of Scholars"
 hee_KOR.3.d:0 "During the rise of the Joseon dynasty, the neo-Confusian scholar Gil Jae had retreated to his home town, where he educated a generation of new scholars. \n\nKing Seongjong invited these Sarim scholars and their followers to the capital. There they served in the Three Offices near the king, and challenged the established order of officials. \n\nOver time, a mix of scholarly conflicts and purges would divide the Sarim into sub-factions, and their conflicts had strong influence on not just Korean intellectual life, but the king himself."
 hee_KOR.3.a:0 "Invite the Sarim to the capital."
 hee_KOR.3.b:0 "No! No more high-falutin' \"thinkers\" with their noses buried in books!"
 hee_KOR.4.t:0 "Censured by the Office of Censors"
 hee_KOR.4.d:0 "The Office of Censors was one of the Three Offices, the government councils meant to keep the Korean balance of power. The task of the Office of Censors is to review major royal decisions and decrees, and ask the king to withdraw them if the are improper.\n\nNow they have set their sights on one of the king's latest decrees, and it happens to be an important one as well."
 hee_KOR.4.a:0 "Convince the Office that the decree is not un-confusian."
 hee_KOR.4.b:0 "Ignore the Office. They are only there to advise, after all."
 hee_KOR.5.t:0 "Hynagyak"
 hee_KOR.5.d:0 "Hyangyak was a contractual agreement between the state and early forms of local government in Korea. The relationship gave local regions greater autonomy, but only because they were governed by a local representative of the king. These were the Yangban.\nThe Yangban were a wide group of local aristocrats, who administered the regional bureaucracy. While the status of Yangban was hereditary, the rights and duties of the hyangyak were not passed on by inheritance, but rather by passing state exams. This ensured competent control on every level of the country's hierarchy.\n\nUnless it was unfortunate with it's king, of course."
 hee_KOR.5.a:0 "Introduce the Hyangyak."
 hee_KOR.5.b:0 "Korea is perfect as it is."
 hee_KOR.5.tt:0 "Every Korean province will institute Hyangyak. (-10% development cost)"
 hee_KOR.6.t:0 "Jo Gwang-jo"
 hee_KOR.6.d:0 "Jo Gwangjo was the consumate seonbi - a virtous scholar, one of the 18 Sages of Korea, and a reformer active in Korea in the early 16th century. His wisdom let him rise to great heights within the Korean hierarchy, where he attempted to reform the recruitment system for new officials.\n\nHe meant that the current tests were too literate, and did not represent the practical skills required in government work. Many older scholars were outraged by these attempts to change the system that had brought them where they were, and matters were made worse when Jo Gwangjo also attempted to remove special priveliges, as well as establishing local self-government through the Hyangyak system. Topping it off with a land reform that aimed at reducing the disparity between rich and poor left Gwangjo with many powerful enemies.\n\nIn the end he was forced to drink poison, and most of his reforms were reversed after his death. However, Jo Gwangjo would go down in Korean history as one of its greatest scholars."
 hee_KOR.6.a:0 "He must show us these reforms he is suggesting."
 hee_KOR.6.b:0 "Administering the provinces is an appropriate task for him."
 hee_KOR.7.t:0 "Queen Jeongsun"
 hee_KOR.7.d:0 "Jeongsun was a wealthy provincial lady before being chosen as the king's new Queen consort in 1757. She quickly made an impression at court, and became known for her wit and skill as an orator.\n\nMore than four decades later, following multiple other kings, she became regent for the young King Sunjo, as she held seniority over everyone else in the palace. In that role she pushed for the Catholic Persecution of 1801, where Korean catholics were persecuted and killed or banished.\n\nFollowing years of rule, Jeongsun willingly gave up the power once the king came of age in 1804."
 hee_KOR.7.a:0 "She can help settle our religious issues."
 hee_KOR.7.b:0 "A Queen Consort worthy of veneration."
 hee_KOR.8.t:0 "The Silhak Movement"
 hee_KOR.8.d:0 "The Silhak Movement was a long-term direction of thought, spanning centuries of Korean history, from the late 16th century onwards. \n\nSilhaks were hoping to change society to get away from the extreme metaphysical nature of Neo-Confusianism, which held little correspondence to the life of Koreans in a quickly changing world.\nThe Silhak movement's supporters wanted to change Korean society to match changes in other areas of life. They pushed for land reforms, stronger focus on Korean national identity, and the abandonment of the rigid Confusian societal structure.\nThese changes were meant to come by through a more realistic and experimental approach to social problems, with the consideration of the walfare of the people, and human equality. The Silhak movement is today considered an important step in the creation of a modern Korea."
 hee_KOR.8.a:0 "I have my doubts, but maybe they can teach us something."
 hee_KOR.9.t:0 "Silhak Scholars Back Westernisation"
 hee_KOR.9.d:0 "A number of Silhak scholars in the state apparatus have banded together in agreement over our recent westwards-looking policies. While they see Enlightenment science as a way of evolving their own empirical-based form of Confusianism, westernisation more than anything presents a path to marking out Korea as a historical entity of its own, not quite as tied to the traditions of its neighbors."
 hee_KOR.9.a:0 "At least someone sees the benefit!"
 hee_KOR.10.t:0 "Yi Sun-sin"
 hee_KOR.10.d:0 "With no naval education, Yi Sun-sin went undefeated in every naval battle he commanded against Japanese invasion forces between 1592 and 1598.\n\nHe is famous for resurrecting and perfecting the design of the Korean turtle ships, giving him an edge in battle. His fleet would frequently be outnumbered, but thanks to his brilliant strategies and quick thinking he always came out on top.\n\nHe received a hero's death, being wounded by a bullet in the naval battle that finally forced the Japanese to abandon Korea. Even as he died, he gave his last order, to not announce his death and let the war drums keep beating. The Koreans carried the day, and Admiral Yi passed into history as one of the greatest naval commanders of all time."
 hee_KOR.10.a:0 "We have use for such an admiral."
 hee_KOR.10.b:0 "Let him instruct our fleets in naval warfare."
 hee_KOR.11.t:0 "The Shipwreck of De Sperwer"
 hee_KOR.11.d:0 "In 1653, the Dutch trading ship De Sperwer shipwrecked off the coast of Korea on a trading mission to Japan. 36 crew members survived and were taken care of in Korea, although they were not allowed to leave due to Korea's strict anti-foreigner policies.\n\nOne of the surviving sailors was Hendrick Hamel, who stayed a captive in Korea for 13 years. The king expected Hamel and the other sailors to lend their expertise in producing muskets to the military, even though they were not technicians. \n\nIn 1666, after 13 years in captivity, Hamel and some other sailors managed to escape the country and return to the Netherlands with the help of another trading mission in Japan. Once home, Hamel published the first western account of Korea in \"Hamel's Journal and a Description of the Kingdom of Korea, 1653-1666.\""
 hee_KOR.11.a:0 "Have the sailors teach us about their trade practices."
 hee_KOR.11.b:0 "They will make muskets for the entire army! Oh... The royal guard, at least?"
