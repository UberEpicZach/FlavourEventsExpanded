 fee_ARA.1.t: "The Assassination of Pedro de Arbués"
 fee_ARA.1.d: "Having seen many religious practices spread across the peninsula since the time of the Romans, Iberia was traditionally a place of tolerance and coexistence. However, in 1478 Queen Isabella I of Castille and King Ferdinand II of Aragon received permission from the Pope to establish the national Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition to replace the papal Inquisition of the middle ages.\n\nOne of the first officers of the Spanish Inquisition was Pedro de Arbués, who relentlessly pursued heretics and \"conversos,\" Jews who had received baptism, but who were often suspected of still practicing Judaism. In 1484, his efforts earned him the position as the Inquisitor Provincial of the Kingdom of Aragon. \nIn Aragon the Inquisiton immediately became unpopular, as it was seen as an attack on the provinces' autonomy. Combined with Arbués' pursuit of influential converso families, he quickly attracted notoriety, and on the 14th of September 1485, he was attacked while attending mass.\nThe presence of conversos among the assailants sparked a movement against Jews, which saw more than twenty executions."
 fee_ARA.1.a: "Arbués was a true man of faith!"
 fee_ARA.1.b: "The Inquisition has gone too far already."
 fee_ARA.2.t: "The War in Ribagorza"
 fee_ARA.2.d: "Following brewing tensions in the county of Ribagorza, the peasants have now risen against their count. They claim that the Count Ribagorza is not their legitimate ruler, and that they should be ruled directly by the Crown. While this is most flattering for our ruler, agreeing to the peasants' demands would greatly upset the nobles of the region."
 fee_ARA.2.a: "These peasants are loyal servants of the Crown."
 fee_ARA.2.b: "The feudal order must be upheld!"
 fee_ARA.3.t: "Alteraciones de Aragón"
 fee_ARA.3.d: "In 1578 Antonio Pérez, long the trusted advisor of King Philip, had his political enemy Juan de Escobedo stabbed to death in a back alley in Madrid, following several clumsy attempts at poisoning him. Although the king originally approved of the plan, he started to question Pérez' motives, and in 1579 arrested him. Many years would pass before Pérez managed to escape to Aragon.\nThere he made himself subject to the regional laws, the fueros, before going on trial before the justice of Aragon. As the court sided with Pérez, the king withdrew his accusation, but presented a new one through his official representative in Aragon. This time Pérez was sentenced to death, but ensured his safety by appealing to the notion that the king was overstepping his bounds and not respecting Aragon's sovreignity.\nAfter the legal process continued to drag on, the king tried to bypass the justice of Aragon by accusing Antonio Pérez of heresy through the Inquisition.As bypassing Aragonese law and custom was exactly what had angered the Aragonese enough to keep Pérez alive, they rose up in revolt. A fed-up King Philip invaded Aragon - formally his own domain - with Castillan troops, and put the chief justice to death without trial as a statement of authority.\n\nAntonio Pérez had already escaped to France and later England, and would die of natural causes in 1611."
 fee_ARA.3.a: "Pérez will be punished, no matter the Aragonese!"
 fee_ARA.3.b: "We'll play by their rules."
 fee_ARA.4.t: "Alteraciones de Aragón"
 fee_ARA.4.d: "In 1578 Antonio Pérez, long the trusted advisor of King Philip, had his political enemy Juan de Escobedo stabbed to death in a back alley in Madrid, following several clumsy attempts at poisoning him.

 fee_ARA.4.a: "I will have the head of Pérez on a platter!"
 fee_ARA.4.b: "We cannot touch him under Aragonese law."
 fee_ARA.5.t: "Alteraciones de Aragón"
 fee_ARA.5.d: "In 1578 Antonio Pérez, long the trusted advisor of King Philip, had his political enemy Juan de Escobedo stabbed to death in a back alley in Madrid, following several clumsy attempts at poisoning him.

 fee_ARA.5.b: "Let's see how long we can drag this trial out for..."
 fee_ARA.6.t: "The Miracle of Calanda"
 fee_ARA.6.d: "A miracle! The Blessed Virgin Mary has healed a man! Miguel Pellicer had his leg amputated two and a half years ago, and unable to work the fields he took to begging, but every night he would ask the priests at the Sanctuary of the Pillar for some oil to rub his leg, believing this to be a way to call upon the favor of the virgin. It must have worked, for this past Easter, Pellicer woke up one day with both his legs! \nNow, following a lengthy inquiry by priests and doctors, the archbishop of Zaragoza has pronounced it a true miracle! As word is spreading, the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar becomes even more famous and prestigous by the day!"
 fee_ARA.6.a: "May the Madonna bless us all!"
 fee_ARA.7.t: "Constructing the Canal Imperial de Aragón"
 fee_ARA.7.d: "For centuries, travel and trade through the Aragonese inland has relied on the river Ebro. Its waters are unpredictable in the Iberian heat however, so our royal engineers have designed a canal, using techniques imported from elsewhere in Europe to bind our country closer together.\nUnder the direction of the cleric Ramón Pignatelly, they are ready to begin their great project."
 fee_ARA.7.a: "It is a worthy project, and just what Aragon needs!"
 fee_ARA.7.b: "Let's employ the people in bettering the old waterways instead."
 fee_ARA.8.t: "The Canal Imperial de Aragón Stands Complete"
 fee_ARA.8.d: "After years of work, the canal has finally opened for boat travel. Already shipments are brought between Zaragoza and Navarra in far greater quantities than before. This lets us export Zaragozan wares across the Atlantic and to Northern Europe, and Navarran goods to the Mediterrenean. Our nations is sure to prosper from this revolutionary waterway!"
 fee_ARA.8.a: "At last. Time to roll in the trade money!"
 fee_ARA.9.t: "The Ciudadela de Jaca"
 fee_ARA.9.d: "The many wars with the enemies to the north has proven time and again that Jaca is of utter strategic importance.\n\nWatching over one of the few crossroads of the Pyrenees, it is key to the defense of the kingdom. We should build a citadel to exert our power."
 fee_ARA.9.a: "The garrison there will be enough."
 fee_ARA.9.b: "Hire the best engineer that can be found."
 fee_ARA.10.t: "A Foreign Viceroy"
 fee_ARA.10.d: "As Aragon and Castile were to be equals under the Spanish crown, but the King of the two countries hailed from Castile, the ancient laws and practices of Aragon had a special protected status. These stated that if the country should be ruled by a viceroy appointed by a foreign king, he must be Aragonese.\n\nAs this practice safeguards the people of Aragon from foreign influence, it contributed to the stability of the union. However, it would not be long before the foreign king appointed a viceroy from his own inner circle, rather than listen to the nobles of Aragon."
 fee_ARA.10.a: "Let our overlord appoint whoever they wish."
 fee_ARA.10.b: "Ensure an Aragonese viceroy."
 fee_ARA.11.t: "Jeronimo Zurita"
 fee_ARA.11.d: "Jeronimo de Zurita y Castro was a an Aragonese historian born in 1512. Born in Zaragoza, he studied in Castile and under Helenist teachers developed his ideas of history. Eventually he would become the official chronicler of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1548. He defined a new historic practice, where the Archives of Aragon alone were not enough, but sources from Rome, Naples and Sicily had to be referenced and compared to create a fuller historical picture of events. Eventually he resigned to dedicate himself to the \"Anales de la Corona de Aragon,\" which would stand the test of time as a central authority on the history of Spain."
 fee_ARA.11.a: "Employ him."
 fee_ARA.11.b: "Support him in defining our history."
 fee_ARA.12.t: "Miguel Servet"
 fee_ARA.12.d: "Miguel Servet was a Spanish renaissance polymath, both a very noteable physician and theologian. He also made advances in mathematics, astronomy and geography, along with writing poetry and interpreting the bible. He was a perfect Renaissance man, any king's dream citizen, except for that last one.\nAs the Protestant Reformation spread across Europe, Servet challenged his own faithand found new thruths in the bible. However, he found both Lutheranism lacking, and even clashed directly with Calvin over his ideas of predestination. In the end, the letters he sent to Calvin proved fatal, as the reformer sent them to Catholic authorities to oust Servet as a heretic. Escaping from France to Italy, Servet stopped in Geneva to hear his opponent preach. Servet was arrested by the reformists however, and in an attempt to prove the orthodoxy of his movement, Calvin pushed to have him executed before Servet's Catholic pursuers could catch up to him.\n\nWithout this unfortunate end, Miguel Servet might have been the source of a reform movement of his own."
 fee_ARA.12.a: "Who cares about his beliefs, the man is a genius!"
 fee_ARA.12.b: "Hunt him down!"
 fee_ARA.13.t: "Michael Servetus tried in $PROVINCE$"
 fee_ARA.13.d: "Michael Servetus was a Spanish physician and scholar, an archetypical Renaissance man. However, his interpretation of the bible brought him into conflict with not just the catholics of Spain and France, but also the established reform movements of Lutheranism and Calvinism.\n\nNow, while on the run from Catholic authorities, he passed through $PROVINCE$, in the hopes of seeing one of our great reformers speak. However, his heretical views on predestination have led to him being arrested by them too, and now he is set to be executed for his beliefs."

 fee_ARA.13.b: "Intervene. He seems to have some interesting ideas."
 fee_ARA.14.t: "Baltasar Gracián"
 fee_ARA.14.d: "Baltasar Gracián was a Spanish writer and philosopher in the first half of the 17th century. He became a Jesuit and an army chaplain, but a lot of his practices were frowned upon by his superiors. However, he continued in reading letters sent from Hell as a form of preaching and publishing unapproved books, the most famous of which is the masterpiece of Spanish literature known as \"El Criticon.\" Despite continuing to have trouble with his religious order, he became the defining voice of Baroque literature in Spain, and the main representative of the literary tradition of Conceptism."
 fee_ARA.14.a: "His wit and thoughtfulness will be popular at court."
 fee_ARA.14.b: "Let him write. His religious order can deal with him."
 fee_ARA.15.t: "The Siege of Zaragoza"
 fee_ARA.15.d: "It should have been such a quick battle. An open city againts the overwhelming armies of the enemy. But the people in Zaragoza are fervent supportes of their $MONARCH$ and ready to die for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. The Marshal commanding the enemy has himself admitted: \"What a war! What men! Having to kill so many brave men, so many furious men. Victory is so sad...\""

 fee_ARA.16.t: "The Channel Construction Requires More Funds"
 fee_ARA.16.d: "The work on the Imperial Channel is slow and constantly requires more funds and time. The Count of Aranda, president of the Royal Council, has arranged the project to be financed by the goverment despite its high cost. However, if the project is to continue, the rest of the Royal Council will have to be convinced."
 fee_ARA.16.a: "Make the council support the project."
 fee_ARA.16.b: "Is this spending really wise?"
 fee_ARA.16.tt: "Work on the channel might be delayed."
 fee_ARA.17.t: "Responsibility for the Construction Project"
 fee_ARA.17.d: "The Count of Aranda has entrusted the new channel project to the clergy, especially the bishop Ramón Pignatelli. His mind is swift and he seems to embrace new Enlightenment ideas. He advocates for new financial institutions for the poor, cultural patronage of the arts, and for reforming both education and the economy."
 fee_ARA.17.a: "This is the man to lead the construction of the channel!"
 fee_ARA.17.b: "Maybe we should pick someone less... passionate."
 fee_ARA.18.t: "Pignatelli Upsets Colleagues"
 fee_ARA.18.d: "Pignatelli has upset his colleagues with new ideas. In order to get more funds, he granted exemptions from Chuch taxes next to the new channel. People have gathered with the promise of irrigated soil and a better future, but a decision must be made between progress and respect for the Church."
 fee_ARA.18.a: "We trust Pignatelli."
 fee_ARA.18.b: "The Holy Church must be respected!"
 fee_ARA.19.t: "Channel Construction Faces Engineering Trouble"
 fee_ARA.19.d: "The terrain is difficult in the proximity to the city of Zaragoza. There are big differences in height and the engineers are afraid cost can increase. However, some of them are hopeful this can bring more prosperity to the land, allowing more mills and fullings."
