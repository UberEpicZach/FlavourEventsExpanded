 FEE_Persia_Events.1.T: "The Qizilbash"
 FEE_Persia_Events.1.D: "The Qizilbash were a conglomeration of Turkoman tribes from Asia Minor who helped Shah Ismail conquer Persia and champion their Shiite faith as the head of the Safavid dynasty. While they revered Ismail as a saint, the fact that the unruly clans were the foundation of Persian power would lead to more than a century of internal struggles."
 FEE_Persia_Events.1.OPT1: "They are here for us now, that is all that matters."

 FEE_Persia_Events.2.T: "The Qizilbash Lend Their Support"
 FEE_Persia_Events.2.D: "The rise of Persia was bought with the blood of Qizilbash warriors. With our armies marching to take back the land that is rightfully ours, a council of chieftains have sent us an additional contingent of soldiers."
 FEE_Persia_Events.2.OPT1: "United for the Shah!"
 FEE_Persia_Events.2.OPT2: "Ask for their guidance."

 FEE_Persia_Events.3.T: "The Qizilbash Fight For Power"
 FEE_Persia_Events.3.D: "Although Shah Ismail was practically worshipped by the Qizilbash tribesmen who had won him Persia, his successors were not to be so fortunate. With the passing of each Shah, the tribes would use intrigue and violence to fight over which candidate was the rightful successor."
 FEE_Persia_Events.3.OPT1: "Long Live the Shah!"
 FEE_Persia_Events.3.OPT2: "Let us ensure the loyalty of the tribes."

 FEE_Persia_Events.4.T: "Qizilbash Plot!"
 FEE_Persia_Events.4.D: "In the early years of the Safavid dynasty, the Shah would curb Qizilbash power by appointing Iranians to high offices. To ensure their own position in the kingdom, the Turkomans would rarely let these appointments stand. If political maneuvering didn't help, it was not uncommon to resort to murder... \n It seems that our latest choice was an unpopular one."
 FEE_Persia_Events.4.OPT1: "The situation will only get worse if we interfere."
 FEE_Persia_Events.4.OPT2: "We will not be slaves to the whim of the tribes!"

 FEE_Persia_Events.5.T: "Pressure From the Qizilbash"
 FEE_Persia_Events.5.D: "Some of the more powerful Qizilbash tribes are protesting our recent policies. While they claim to acknowledge the power of the Shah, they are eager to point out what would happen if he loses their support."
 FEE_Persia_Events.5.OPT1: "Let them have their way."
 FEE_Persia_Events.5.OPT2: "Resist every way we can!"
 FEE_Persia_Events.5.OPT3: "Those who oppose us will be driven out!"

 FEE_Persia_Events.6.T: "The Third Force"
 FEE_Persia_Events.6.D: "As the result of campaigns in Georgia and Armenia in the late 16th century, Caucasian slaves were brought to Persia in their tens of thousands. They became valued soldiers and royal servants, but it was not until Shah Abbas the Great that they became a political force of their own, loyal only to the Shah. Abbas expanded their army regiments and ensured them positions in the royal administration, and soon many of them were among Persia's highest ranking officers and administrators. Over time, this third political force would ensure the decline of the Qizilbash."
 FEE_Persia_Events.6.OPT1: "We need them to reform our society!"
 FEE_Persia_Events.6.OPT2: "The Qizilbash is no threat to the Shah."

 FEE_Persia_Events.7.T: "End of Tribal Independence"
 FEE_Persia_Events.7.D: "After more than a century of political struggle with the Shah, changes in Persian society spelled the end of Qizilbash power. While the Turkoman tribes were still an important part of Persia, their leaders no longer ruled as independent chieftains, and they would never again get to choose their Shah. Although Persia continued to struggle with rebellions, these would not be led by chieftains, but by self-styled kings."
 FEE_Persia_Events.7.OPT1: "No-one will ever hold Persia hostage again!"

 FEE_Persia_Events.8.T: "Decline of the Qizilbash"
 FEE_Persia_Events.8.D: "After centuries of infighting, the Qizilbash were overtaken by centralisation and modern statesmanship. The violent intrigues of the tribes made way for new governing forces, and Persia became a more centralised kingdom. While rebellions would continue to frequently challenge the Shah, they no longer came from the Qizilbash."
 FEE_Persia_Events.8.OPT1: "It is time Persia looked to the future."
