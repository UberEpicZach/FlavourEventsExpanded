 FEE_Netherlands_Events.1.T: "Province Named Generality Lands"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.1.D: "Due to the challenges of administrating the population of it, the States-General has decided to name the region Generaliteitslande, or \"Generality Lands.\" This means that instead of being subject to one of the seven United Provinces, it will be governed directly by the States-General itself. \nThese regions are not represented in the central government - which might be best, considering their beliefs - and have no States-Provincial of their own.\n\nOne day we might have reason to let them be represented and govern themselves, but for now holding them as a dependent territory is best."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.1.OPT1: "The States-General votes unanimously in favor."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.2.T: "Province Achieves Representation"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.2.D: "After showing signs of development and stability, the region of it has finally been granted the right to its own administration. This comes with the responsibility of sending representatives to the States-General, and in time the former Generality Lands might even earn its own States-Provincial!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.2.OPT1: "We are all people of the Netherlands, after all."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.3.T: "Arrival in Indonesia"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.3.D: "Our expedition to the East Indies has finally arrived! This morning we received news that after careful negotiations with the Sultan of Banten that our brave merchants and explorers have established a trading post there. Our merchants have also received an offer from the Prince of Jayakarta to construct a warehouse nearby. Should we accept? "
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.3.OPT1: "We shall take the good Prince up on his offer."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.3.OPT2: "We should steer clear of this. "

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.4.T: "Founding of Batavia"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.4.D: "We have had many trading ports in Asia since the VOC were given a monopoly over trade in Asia. One of our biggest was the warehouse at Jayakarta, however after long tensions with the English and the Natives of the region, the natives attempted to destroy the warehouses. In retaliation, the brave troops of the East India Company razed Jayakarta to the ground! However, VOC officials are now proposing to construct an organised Dutch city upon its ruins called Batavia and are asking for a grant."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.4.OPT1: "Let us found this bastion of the Dutch."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.4.OPT2: "These acts are barbaric!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.5.T: "Formosa"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.5.D: "With our expansion in the East Indies it is time to pose the ultimate challenge to our rivals, the Portuguese. We must begin trade with the Middle Kingdom and prove ourselves dominant in Asia. For this purpose, we need a base closer to China. The island of Formosa serves perfectly, being largely uninhabited and mere miles from China itself."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.5.OPT1: "Establish a colony."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.6.T: "Koxinga and Tungning"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.6.D: "With the imminent collapse of the Ming Dynasty, a young general called Koxinga has fled to Northern Formosa, seeking to use it as a base to retake the mainland and restore Ming rule to China. The problem, of course, is that of our own colony in Formosa. Koxinga has issued us a demand to cede it, either willingly or by force."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.6.OPT1: "A fractured China is worthless to us, concede the colony."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.6.OPT2: "Over my dead body!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.7.T: "The Dutch Impede Us"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.7.D: "In order to fight the pretenders to the Mandate of Heaven, we must first secure our own borders. Expel the Dutch from Taiwan!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.7.OPT1: "Lay Siege to Zeelandia!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.7.OPT2: "The Dutch are too powerful."

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.8.T: "The Supreme Court of Holland"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.8.D: "While Den Haag has long served as the administrative center of the Hollanders, the steady increase of the region in population, wealth, and influence has required ever more legal protections and effective administration of justice, a need which has outgrown our institutions' ability to provide it. Especially important for an area so dependent on trade is the consistent and meaningful enforcement of contracts and the protection of property rights. These are two cornerstones of any successful economy. \nTo that end, it has been proposed that a new standardized court system be set up, one that not only is independent over legal matters in our lands, but also regulates commerce on the high seas going through our ports. \nThe flagship of this new court system would be in the Hague, the better to maintain independence from the merchant interests in fast-growing Amsterdam or the nobility interests further inland. "
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.8.OPT1: "Let the Hague be an example to the rest of the world!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.9.T: "The Corneliszoon Sawmill"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.9.D: "While it may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the sawmill was invented in Holland, since sawmills have existed since Roman times, Cornelis Corneliszoon was the first to craft a round saw blade that was attached via a pitman arm onto a windmill. This vastly increased the speed and efficiency at which a sawmill operated, and allowed for a rapid expansion of Dutch maritime capability."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.9.OPT1: "Excellent!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.10.T: "Defensive Reforms"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.10.D: "Since the Middle Ages, the Dutch have been unique in the world for their ability to build great dikes, walls to keep out the sea itself. More recently, wars of independence and the strategic vulnerability of our lands have trained us in the arts of building state-of-the-art forts on our frontiers. The invention of the bastion is just the latest in the European-wide arms race between defense and offense. We must be prepared to keep up to maintain our edge."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.10.OPT1: "Spare no expenses in investing for our defense"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.10.OPT2: "Our brave soldiers, not stone walls, are how we must defend ourselves"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.11.T: "Michiel de Ruyter"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.11.D: "While Michiel de Ruyter has already had a full and illustrious career, serving everything from a musket under Maurice of Nassau to a pirate-hunter aboard privately-owned ships, his latest assignment has brought him fully to our attention. \nWhile assigned as captain of a state-owned man-of-war hunting Portuguese raiders, he distinguished himself in combat against a combined Spanish and Portuguese fleet. \nThere, despite an cautious nature on land, he showed exemplary boldness and steadfastness in the face of dangerous undertakings. He would go down in history as one of the most skilled naval leaders in Dutch history."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.11.OPT1: "He shall be made an admiral!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.11.OPT2: "His advice is essential for the state!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.12.T: "A Daring Attack"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.12.D: "However regrettable the circumstances may or may not be, we find ourselves at war with the English over the question of naval supremacy. However, word has been leaked that the English have been forced to lay in their fleet for repairs due to budget concerns. \nTo most navies, this would put them safely out of reach for repairs. But we will not be so easily discouraged. One of our leading politicians, working in conjunction with one of our best admirals, has devised a bold operation the likes of which has never been attempted against the English navy. He proposes to sail our navy into the mouth of the Thames itself, engage the fortifications there directly and attack the English fleet while it is unable to move or defend itself."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.12.OPT1: "Fortune favors the bold!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.13.T: "Raid on the Medway"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.13.D: "Utter disaster has befallen our glorious fleet! Despite ample warning by our spies in Holland, the Naval Board completely discounted the idea that the Dutch would dare launch an attack into the Thames itself. Imagine our shock, then, when a morning fog lifted to reveal the horrible sight of the entire Dutch navy bearing down on the Thames! \nhe Dutch broke through out defensive chains and burned many of our finest ships, even capturing the flagship itself! Many prominent voices begin to fear that a defeat of this scale might prove the undoing of the whole kingdom. The city of London has flown into a panic of the now-dreaded Dutch! And well they might, for this will go down in history as the worst defeat ever suffered by the Royal Navy, and one of the worst in all our military history!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.13.OPT1: "Horrors!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.14.T: "Raid on the Medway"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.14.D: "Totally unprepared for our bold move, we have inflicted nothing short of catastrophe on the enemy navy! We even managed to unmoor two of the best ships and take them back to Amsterdam for ourselves. \nThis great victory has reinvigorated the people in this war, and will doubtless lead to a more favorable peace deal as well as go down in history. Celebrations of this victory continued through the night throughout the nation"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.14.OPT1: "Glorious!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.15.T: "Dutch Settlers at the Cape"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.15.D: "nitially, the only Dutch presence at the Cape of Good Hope was a VOC supply post for ships on the way to the Indies. It was never thought that it would become a destination for Dutch settlers; indeed, for much of the history of the Republic we have been a destination for immigrants rather than a source of emigration. \nLately, however, rumors of rich farmland and a labor shortage in the VOC has encourage a rare outpouring of Dutch migration there. Dutch Calvinists, mostly farmers from the interior Netherlands where trade wealth wasn't as abundant as on the coast, were the majority of the immigrants, but they were quickly followed by Germans and French Huguenots as well. Soon, the immigrants even ventured out beyond the Cape, which itself was becoming a developed city in its own right. \nDespite this influx, the VOC has been reticent to invest any more into the well-being of the colony, treating it as little more than a glorified campsite."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.15.OPT1: "Encourage the settlers of Cape Town!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.15.OPT2: "Encourage the settlement of the hinterlands!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.15.OPT3: "This is a matter for the VOC alone"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.T: "The Grand Alliance"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.D: "It has been a geopolitical constant of Europe that France, with its huge population, fertile soil, and absolutist rule has been the most powerful nation in Western Europe, if not all of the European continent. \nWith the weakening of the Holy Roman Emperor, long the counterweight to French ambitious, by religious wars, and even rumors of a Franco-Ottoman alliance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided that it is high time the powers of western Europe formalize their intention to contain France. Accordingly, all nations with an interest in doing so shall receive invitations to meet in the Hague and form a Grand Alliance against the French."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.OPT1: "Let the Treaty be signed!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.16.OPT2: "On second thought, we can handle this ourselves"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.17.T: "Rembrandt"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.17.D: "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, commonly known simply as Rembrandt, was a Dutch painter, printmaker, and draughtsman from Leiden. An innovator in all three distinct art media, he is widely considered one of the greatest artists in history and single-handedly embodied the Dutch Golden Age of the arts. He became famous for his intimate and brooding self-portraits, prints of scenes from the Bible, and his pioneering work in the technique of etching. \nIn opposition to the prevailing Baroque style of the age, and to the art styles which preceded them, Rembrandt's paintings, like those of other Dutch masters, presented ordinary life scenes as objects of high art. This “democratization” of art showed such empathy for ordinary human life that he was called “one of the great prophets of civilization."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.17.OPT1: "A true master of the arts!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.T: "Huguenot Refugees"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.D: "The relatively tolerant order established in France after the French Wars of Religion is rapidly deteriorating. The rise of absolutism in our larger neighbor has led to the revocation of legal protections for the French minority of Protestants known as Huguenots. In addition, the continued actions of the Inquisition in Spain and religious conflicts ongoing in Germany have made our Republic into an island of peace and stability. While constant conflict in Europe results in rampant poverty, in Amsterdam there are always jobs! \nNaturally, these people of all faiths wish to seek a better life in our trading cities."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.OPT1: "By all means, let them in!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.18.OPT2: "They would only bring all their problems here"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.T: "Dike Piercing"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.D: "Come my friends, the Dutch are going to war! It is likely that we go to our doom. The last march of the Dutch!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.OPT1: "Break the dikes! Release the water!"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.19.OPT2: "Our business is to fight, not flee!"

 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.T: "Lack of Investment in Manufacturing "
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.D: "Our dominance of the global trade networks has brought unprecedented wealth to our shores. Even as other nations begin to copy our techniques for trade and ship-building, we ourselves have become complacent. Many merchants seem content to continue accruing profit from existing trade routes, heedless of the looming competition, while our investors find foreign opportunities more lucrative than our own nation swamped in excess capital. \nOur emphasis on trade has led us this far, but an investment into our nations manufacturing capacity is critical if we are to avoid being left behind by other nations. Alternatively, some suggest that we could pawn our gains from trade back into the finances markets which so helped us before, that we may create a self-reinforcing cycle of financial growth without additional spending or investment."
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.OPT1: "The world is changing, and industry is the future"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.OPT2: "The investment of capital is core to a nation's success"
 FEE_Netherlands_Events.20.OPT3: "Trade is the lifeblood of nations, we would be foolish to abandon it now"
