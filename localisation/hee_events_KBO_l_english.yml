 hee_KBO.1.d:0 "In the late 15th century, Kanem Borno had struggled for decades with infighting and power struggles among the nobility. As the king finally stamped out the last vestiges of resistance, the conflicts still seemed to simmer just under the surface.\nIn order to counter regionalism and centralise the kingdom, the capital was moved to Ngazargamu where a fortress city was built. This city was the first permanent residence for a king in a century, and would be the heart of the Kanem Bornu empire until its fall."
 hee_KBO.1.a:0 "Build the city."
 hee_KBO.1.b:0 "Our lands are already as well protected as they need to."
 hee_KBO.2.t:0 "The Epic of Idris Aluma"
 hee_KBO.2.d:0 "In the latter half of the 16th century, Kanem Bornu was ruled by the great king Idris Aluma. In addition to being a social reformer, he achieved great military successes against Kanem Bornu's enemies, such as Hausa and the Tuaregs. These victories were in part thanks to his employment of military innovations such as walled military camps, permanent sieges and scorched earth tactics.\n\nThe heroic epic that was written about him describes how he won over a thousand victories in more than three hundred and thirty wars during his reign."

 hee_KBO.3.d:0 "Mai Idris Aluma was one of the great kings of Kanem Bornu, and was responsible for a legal code that would form the basis of the rest of the empire's existence. His reforms were based on Islamic law, and included the establishment of a royal advisory council consisting of the heads of the largest clan in the kingdom.\nAluma also relied heavily on slaves educated in noble homes as administrators, and he required anyone of political significance to live at his court, so that the kingdom could be governed efficiently. He improved the road system and built wells along them, introduced new boat designs to Lake Chad, introduced a standard measure for grain, and moved farmers to new, more fertile lands."
 hee_KBO.3.a:0 "Implement the full reforms."
 hee_KBO.3.b:0 "Just implement the tax reforms."
