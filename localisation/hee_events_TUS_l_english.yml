 fee_TUS.1.t: "The Thornton Expedition"
 fee_TUS.1.d: "In 1608, Captain Robert Thornton was commissioned by Ferdinando de Medici to prepare for the establishment of a Tuscan settlement in South America.\nThornton was successful in his journey, and following exploration of the Amazon and the Orinoco he planned for the colony to be established in what is today French Guyana.\n\nWith a perfect place found, and without losing a single man on the expedition, Thornton returned to Tuscany. However, Ferdinando had died, and his successor was uninterested in continuing the colonisation project of his predecessor. Despite the testimony of both Thornton and a native he had brought back that there were many riches and much commerce to be found, no one could be convinced to pursue the scheme of a colony.\nThis saw the end of the only attempt by an Italian state to colonise the New World."
 fee_TUS.1.a: "Send him off to found our colony!"
 fee_TUS.1.b: "A commissioned captain would be very useful."
 fee_TUS.1.c: "This captain speaks madness, send him away."
 fee_TUS.2.t: "Freedom of Religion in Tuscany"
 fee_TUS.2.d: "In the late 16th century, Cosimo de Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany introduced laws that would allow his citizens great freedoms in the practice of their religion. Thanks to his good relations with the Pope, Cosimo was able to ban the clergy from holding administrative positions, and allow people to choose their own method of worship.\nNearly eight decades before the Peace of Westphalia these laws were unprecedented in Europe, and especially in a catholic princedom. Nevertheless it led to Tuscany becoming an early destination for religious migrants, aiding the Grand Duchy's prosperity."
 fee_TUS.2.a: "These are wise reforms."
 fee_TUS.2.b: "No. Every soul in our duchy must follow the $MONARCHTITLE$'s lead."
 fee_TUS.3.t: "The Emperor Condemns Tuscany's Elevation"
 fee_TUS.3.d: "The Pope has finally acknowledged the achievements of the Duchy of Florence, and proclaimed it a Grand Duchy. However, not everyone is thrilled by this acknowledgement of our glory.\nThe emperorhas condemned the Pope's proclamation as invalid, as Tuscany is nominally an imperial fief."
 fee_TUS.3.a: "The emperor will not stand in the way of God's will."
 fee_TUS.4.t: "The Emperor Confirms Tuscany's Elevation"
 fee_TUS.4.d: "The Pope has finally acknowledged the achievements of the Duchy of Florence, and proclaimed it a Grand Duchy. However, some have had reservations as Tuscany is - at least nominally - an imperial fief.\nThankfully, the emperor has done the right thing, and proclaimed that the Pope's decree is God's will, and should be respected by all. We are now ready to take our place as one of the greatest states of Europe."
 fee_TUS.4.a: "All is right."
 fee_TUS.5.t: "The Construction Projects of Fernandino I"
 fee_TUS.5.d: "Grand Duke Fernandino I was a kind ruler, always attempting to improve the situation of his subjects. One of his grand undertakings were extensive development projects in Tuscany.\n\nUnder his rule, roads were improved and developed across the duchy. Even more significantly, he oversaw the draining of much Tuscan marshland around Pisa, opening new land for settlement and industry. This was done by - among other things - the diverting of the Arno River into the Naviglio canal, which served to improve commerce between Florence and Pisa."
 fee_TUS.5.a: "Implement the projects in full."
 fee_TUS.5.b: "Expand the road network and charge high tolls."
 fee_TUS.6.t: "The $MONARCHTITLE$'s Treasury"
 fee_TUS.6.d: "Tuscany under the $DYNASTY$s were long a financial powerhouse. However, thanks to banking and ownership of much of the local industry, the ruler exerted so much control over the duchy's economy that the distinction between personal and state funds was largely negligible.\nFor example did the Grand Duke have exclusive rights to the state's extraction of salt and minerals, but at the same time those funds were expected to also benefit the state. However, with so much personal control, what was state money and what was family money largely came down to the personality of the Grand Duke at the time."
 fee_TUS.6.a: "What difference is there between the interests of the $DYNASTY$s and of Tuscany?"
 fee_TUS.6.b: "The $DYNASTY$s rule for the Tuscan people."
 fee_TUS.7.t: "Accademia del Cimento"
 fee_TUS.7.d: "The Accademia del Cimento was a scientific society established in Florence in 1657. It was one of the first of its kind, founded by students of Galielo and funded by Prince Leopold and his brother, the Grand Duke Ferdinando II.\nWhile it was never an official institution, and only kept meeting until Prince Leopold became a cardinal and moved to Rome in 1667, it was important for the development of the scientific principles of experimentation. It had the motto \"Try and try again,\" and published \"the Saggi,\" a book that became the standard laboratory manual of the 18th century (\"'Saggi di naturali esperienze fatte nell'Accademia del Cimento sotto la protezione del Serenissimo Principe Leopoldo di Toscan e descritte dal segretario di essa Accademia\")."
 fee_TUS.7.a: "Scientific societies sound very useful."
 fee_TUS.7.b: "We need to institutionalize the society for the benefit of $COUNTRY$."
 fee_TUS.8.t: "The Puritan Reforms of Cosimo III"
 fee_TUS.8.d: "Cosimo III, the second to last Medici Grand Duke, was a harsh ruler, who thanks to disastrous financial policies and tyrannical practices forced the population numbers of Tuscany into an even steeper decline than it had been for the last century.\nNot only did he ruin Tuscany's economy and military strength, but also ended it's long tradition of religious toleration. Jews were banned from from having intercourse with Christians, and Christians were not allowed to work in establishments owned by Jews. Eventually Jews were forbidden from living with Christians as well, along with being forbidden from visiting Christian prostitutes (no doubt to protect their Christian virtue).Being a Puritan, Cosimo's legal reforms affected Christian life significantly as well, banning May celebrations and beheading sodomites.\n\nIn his defence, he desperately needed the money he got from fining crimes that did not result in swift execution."
 fee_TUS.8.a: "Ban these disgusting May celebrations and seize that delicious gold!"
 fee_TUS.8.b: "$COUNTRY$ cannot afford to be anything except tolerant."
 fee_TUS.8.c: "$COUNTRY$ has always been accepting of all kinds of practices."
 fee_TUS.8.c.tt: "Unlocked by having Humanist Ideas"
 fee_TUS.10.t: "The Liberal Reforms of Peter Leopold"
 fee_TUS.10.d: "Peter leopold of the house Habsburg-Lorraine, who ruled Tuscany between 1765 and 1790, was unpopular for an unusual reason. He introduced extensive social, legal and financial reforms in Tuscany, but met extensive opposition from all strata of society, as the reforms were considered too liberal. \nReforming the tax system to ease the burden on citizens, and conducting profitable public works were well received, but his attempts at reducing the power of the clergy was stopped by opposition from the Pope and his political allies. He did achieve many things, however, especially in guaranteeing legal rights for citizens, as well as through legislation and development of hospitals vastly improving the treatment of the mentally ill. This took place through the \"legge sui pazzi,\" the law of the insane, which was the first of its kind in Europe. \nA system for inoculation against smallpox was set up as an early predecessor of vaccination programs, and an early institution for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents was founded. Peter Leopold also approved and attempted to introduce a constitution in Tuscany, which would see greater rights given to its citizens, and ensure a balance between legislative and executive powers.\n\nThe constitution met fierce resistance, even from those who would benefit from it, and was never put into effect, as Leopold in 1790 moved to Vienna upon his ascension to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire."
 fee_TUS.10.a: "Implement these excellent reforms."
 fee_TUS.10.b: "If the people don't want them we should place our efforts elsewhere."
 fee_TUS.12.t: "The Medici Oriental Press"
 fee_TUS.12.d: "The Medici Oriental Press was a printing press house established by Ferdinand de Medici in 1584. It had the objective of printing Christian works in Arabic, in the hopes of converting Muslims, and was granted a monopoly by the Pope to print books in \"foreign languages.\"\nThe press published some of the earliest printed works in Arabic, which came to include multiple non-religious works. It printed scientific works in original Arabic for circulation among European scientists, along with ancient Greek works translated and disseminated in Arabic."
 fee_TUS.12.a: "We might actually have a lot to learn from the rest of the world. Just don't tell the Pope."
