 hee_SWI.1.t:0 "Swiss Mercenaries Succeed Abroad"
 hee_SWI.1.d:0 "In the late middle ages, Swiss mercenaries became a common sight on the battlefields of Europe. This was in no small part thanks to the fact that the Swiss cantons organised and trained regiments that could be bought into service in other parts of Europe. \nThe Swiss became known as some of the deadliest soldiers in Europe, as they were trained to work together to perform devastating mass attacks as a single unit. \n\nEventually, after two centuries of being the finest soldiers on the battlefields of Europe, Swiss mercenaries would find their match in the widespread use of firearms."
 hee_SWI.1.a:0 "This can only be good for Switzerland."
 hee_SWI.1.b:0 "Let us establish another regiment."
 hee_SWI.2.t:0 "Swiss Mercenaries in Our Army"
 hee_SWI.2.d:0 "Ever since the battle of Basel in 1474, Swiss mercenaries made up the very core of French infantry troops. These soldiers, with their bravery and military tactics, were some of the finest fighters in all of Europe. Only when the traditional formations of pikes and halberds were overtaken by ubiquitous firearms would the French kings come to rely more heavily on national regiments."
 hee_SWI.2.a:0 "Request more troops from the Swiss!"
 hee_SWI.2.a.tt:0 "The Swiss cantons will hear our request."
 hee_SWI.3.t:0 "In Service of the French King"
 hee_SWI.3.d:0 "The very core of the French army relies on regiments of Swiss infantry to hold the line. The French [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] has requested that we bless our cantons’ participation in French wars."
 hee_SWI.3.a:0 "This seems the beginning of a very fruitful partnership."
 hee_SWI.3.b:0 "These men will fight for Switzerland, not France!"
 hee_SWI.3.tt:0 "The French [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] will not be pleased."
 hee_SWI.4.t:0 "Switzerland Condemns Mercenaries"
 hee_SWI.4.d:0 "How dare they?! Switzerland has claimed that Swiss soldiers should only ever fight for Swiss cantons! The regiments already fighting for us are getting paid too much to leave, of course, but this is an irreparable offense."
 hee_SWI.4.a:0 "If only French troops were the best in Europe instead of Swiss! Ah, a [FRA.Monarch.GetTitle] can dream."
 hee_SWI.5.t:0 "Jörg Jenatsch"
 hee_SWI.5.d:0 "Born in Gräbunden in 1596, Jörg Jenatsch was a protestant theologian and politician while the Thirty Year’s War ravaged the rest of the Holy Roman Empire. \nHe was involved in the political struggle around the Valtellina region between France and Venice on one side and the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs on the other, where he led the anti-Spanish faction. \nA violent life led him to lose his position in the church, but he excelled as a soldier, and eventually came to command his own regiment. He went on trial for murder an insubordination, but only sat in prison in Venice while serving there. \n\nIn 1635 Jenatsch was assassinated by a man costumed as a bear, an unfortunate end probably brought on by the several murders he had committed in his struggles."
 hee_SWI.5.a:0 "He should advise us in the art of war."
 hee_SWI.5.b:0 "Let us send him into the field."
 hee_SWI.6.t:0 "Bündner Wirren"
 hee_SWI.6.d:0 "The Bündner Wirren, or Confusion of the Leagues, was a chaotic period in the history of Switzerland lasting from 1618 to 1639, where France and Venice contested with the Habsburgs of Spain and Austria to control the Valtelline area in Gräubunden. \nThe valley was one of the most important passes between Austria and Italy, and whoever controlled it could largely dictate how much Austria would be able to reinforce the Habsburg armies there. Gradually the strategic conflict became one of religion, and the entirety of Gräubunden got involved on one side or the other. \nThe valley changed allegiance multiple times, before settling in the hands of the leagues of Gräubunden in exchange for a guarantee of free exercise of the catholic faith."
 hee_SWI.6.a:0 "The valley must oppose Catholic influence."
 hee_SWI.6.b:0 "We would not dare oppose the Habsburgs."
 hee_SWI.7.t:0 "Johann Rudolf Wettstein"
 hee_SWI.7.d:0 "The Mayor of Basel and a lifelong public servant, Johann Rudolf Wettstein participated in the negotiations for the Peace of Westphalia, despite not having been invited, and despite the Confederacy’s initial refusal to accredit him. He quickly proved himself as a diplomat, however, and through long, grueling negotiations managed to secure official recognition of Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire."
 hee_SWI.7.a:0 "He will serve our country well as a diplomat."
 hee_SWI.7.b:0 "He will certainly do well for us in foreign courts."
 hee_SWI.7.c:0 "He will do the most good here at home."
 hee_SWI.8.t:0 "The Bernoulli Family"
 hee_SWI.8.d:0 "The Bernoullis were an entire family of mathematicians, a scientific dynasty spanning a hundred years from the late 17th century. While originally from Germany, the family settled in Switzerland to escape religious persecution. \nThey were behind multiple discoveries within a range of mathematical fields, from probability to calculus. They also made important discoveries in physics, including Bernoulli's Principle, the principle that would later be used to develop the carburetor and the airplane wing. \n\nAcross three generations, the family gave rise to no less than eight prominent mathematicians."
 hee_SWI.8.a:0 "With thinkers like these, we will lead the enlightenment of peoples."
