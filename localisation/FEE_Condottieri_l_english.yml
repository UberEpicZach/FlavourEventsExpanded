His presence in the Tuscan ranks could undoubtedly alter the balance of power in the region, potentially tipping the scales in favor of our allies. \nYet, Attendolo's departure would leave a void in our own military structure, potentially exposing us to threats from rival powers. His absence would be deeply felt, not only for his tactical acumen but also for his ability to inspire and lead our troops. \nThe decision was further complicated by the potential for unintended consequences.

Attendolo, a seasoned veteran of countless battles, is renowned for his strategic brilliance and unwavering leadership. His expertise on the battlefield is coveted by powers across the region, and the lords of Milan recognize that his presence in their ranks could significantly strengthen their position. The offer of Pozzolo Formigaro, a fertile and strategically located territory, is not without its appeal. It would provide Attendolo with a secure home for himself and his wife, Isabella, a place where they could enjoy the fruits of his labors in peace and prosperity. However, Attendolo is not merely a mercenary seeking personal gain. He is a man of honor and loyalty, deeply committed to the cause of his current employer.
