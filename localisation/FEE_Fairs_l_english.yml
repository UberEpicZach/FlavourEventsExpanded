 FEE_Fairs_Events.1.T: "The Trading Fairs"
 FEE_Fairs_Events.1.D: "In the Middle Ages, many fairs were transformed into temporary markets of special importance for international and long-distance trade, as many traders made journeys of up to days to reach places where they were sure they could do business. The fairs were usually connected to religious celebrations, such as the day of the patron saint of the locality. On these occasions, the rulers granted exemption from duties and taxes thus making the prices of the goods sold cheaper. The privilege of the Fair, in Latin nundinas, was granted or confirmed to a town or city by means of a special royal diploma or of the reigning feudal lord written on parchment and was fitted with a leaden seal inside which the heraldic coat of arms of who he had released him. The diploma describes the motivation, the place and date where the fair was held each year, the duration (generally eight consecutive days) and the relative exemptions (taxes, duties, etc.). This privilege stimulated the influx of buyers from outside, attracted by the possibility of saving and concluding deals in a more convenient way. Important was the function of the \"mastromercato\" or \"master of the fair\" which, in addition to regulating the exchange of goods, had control of the criminal jurisdiction of the city limited to the period of the fair. Modern trade fairs have their roots in European business fairs of the late Middle Ages in the period of development of mercantile capitalism: an example is the Champagne fairs, active since the 12th century.
