 FEE_Multan_Events.1.T: "Ascension of the Langa"
 FEE_Multan_Events.1.D: "Multan has been in a state of turmoil since the sack of Delhi by Tamerlane in 1398. For all this time, we have suffered from internal strife and incompetent rulers whose courts do not even reside in the Panjabi heartland. However, a turn for the better came; an influential Sheikh was elected into power and stability seemed to be returning. But in 1443, a conspiracy led by Rae Sahra of the Afghan Langas exiled the Sheikh to Delhi and Sahra installed himself as Sultan. Under this new dynasty, we can only hope that order can return to Multan once more."
 FEE_Multan_Events.1.OPT1: "The time for them to accept their new sultans has not yet come."
