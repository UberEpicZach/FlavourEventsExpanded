### Moldavian Events
 FEE_Balkan_Events.100.T: "Atletul lui Hristos"
 FEE_Balkan_Events.100.D: "Since the 15th century, \"Athleta Christi,\" or Champion of Christ, was a title granted by the pope to men who had defended Christianity by leading campaigns against the enemies of the faith. \nStephen III of Moldavia was granted the title in 1475, after a defeat of the Ottomans that was decisive enough for the Pope to proclaim him \"Verus Christianae Fidei Athleta,\" True Champion of the Christian Faith."

 FEE_Balkan_Events.101.T: "Mount Athos"
 FEE_Balkan_Events.101.D: "Mount Athos was the home to 20 Orthodox monasteries in Ottoman-occupied Greece. They were under the direct authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople, and tried to keep good terms with the sultan after the right to their land had been confirmed by Murad II in 1453. However, by the late 15th century, the monasteries had ended up in debt to the Sultan, and they now stood to lose the land they were built on. \nStephen III, however, drew from his personal coffers to pay off their loan, so that the Greek monasteries would not be lost."

 FEE_Balkan_Events.101.OPT2: "We cannot afford that."

 FEE_Balkan_Events.102.T: "Vasile Lupu"
 FEE_Balkan_Events.102.D: "Born in 1595 and known as \"The Wolf\" (Lupu), Vasile was a capable administrator and a great schemer who came to the throne of Moldavia through a series of complicated intrigues. Once in power he turned out to be a brilliant financer, and became one of the richest men in Eastern Europe. His wealth sustained gifts to the Ottoman sultan, which placated Moldavia's overlord and kept the country in good standing. \nVasile Lupu was a builder and a patron of the arts, but at the cost of unbearable taxation on the peasantry. Eventually he would come into conflict with the prince of Wallachia, who after long wars replace him with one of his own nobles. Lupu died in a prison in Constantinople in 1661, eight years after being deposed."

### Bulgarian Events
 FEE_Balkan_Events.200.T: "Reconstruction of Tsarevets"
 FEE_Balkan_Events.200.D: "During their occupation, the Ottomans destroyed numerous fortresses in our lands in order to lower the chance of rebellion by our people. Tsarevets was one such fortress, besieged in 1393, it has been left to crumble through the ages. The church, which lies on the peak of the hill in the inner parts of the fortress, gets few visitors anymore. The town outside the Fortress has grown a lot after the fall of Bulgaria in 1396. To honor the glory of the brothers Asen and Peter, we must rebuild the fortress, from where the second life of Bulgaria began. The walls will be expanded and remade, the bridge connecting the fortress to the city will be renovated! With the help of skilled Bulgarians, Tsarevets will exceed the glory of any previous Bulgarian city!"

 FEE_Balkan_Events.201.T: "Bulgarian Military Parades Through Tsargrad"
 FEE_Balkan_Events.201.D: "Many though our ambitions to be the sole hegemon of the Balkans were outrageous, that we'd be smote from the Earth, just like in 1382; Alas, we rose and we destroyed all who opposed us, we showed the world our prestige and today we celebrate our conquests and our prosperity; today! we cheer for the men who sacrificed themselves in the name of the Tsar, today! we cheer for the women, who nurtured our children, who kept our country fledgling. In this time, we had built an academy in the city, to teach our reserve soldiers how to entertain the people for such commodities as this and today we see the result. Soldiers march past the Column of Constantine, the Obelisk of Theodosius and the Hagia Sophia. Our Tsar follows behind, usually seen in robe, today is seen in an officer's uniform, marching with the soldiers, greeting his people blessing infants and showing them, that he is a human too, that he would be nothing; if not for them. Following the march, comes a show of brilliance, soldiers showing their discipline, cavalry using their horses to jump obstacles and a brand of cannon that shoot explosives from the lands of the east. These festivities have shown the people, that our dynasty was truly chosen by the gods and that we will protect the interests of not only those who are of Bulgarian birth, but those who she protects inside her borders."
 FEE_Balkan_Events.201.OPT1: "Dulgo da caruva Tsarya! Spokoino da zhivee naroda! I nepobedima da e Bulgaria!"

 FEE_Balkan_Events.202.T: "Statue of Simeon the Great"
 FEE_Balkan_Events.202.D: "After much debate on what to do to celebrate our great nation, many historians recommend that we build a statue in the honour of Simeon the Great, the first Tsar of Bulgaria. The architects in our court tell us that we should make it out of marble, as to mirror the Greek myth that Konstantinos XI was turned to marble, and he would return to restore Rome when Constantinople was returned to them. Our generals tell us that we should make him a Saint of War, as to rally troops easier and to instil honour into our soldiers. Our Merchants tell us to make him a shining light in the dark of the Mediterranean, to help guide the Merchants to our glorious nation. It's up to our ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide."
 FEE_Balkan_Events.202.OPT1: "A symbol to instil honour into our soldiers."
