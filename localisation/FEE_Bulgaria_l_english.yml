 FEE_Bulgaria_Events.1.tt: "Reconstruction of Tsarevets"
 FEE_Bulgaria_Events.1.dd: "During their occupation, the Ottomans destroyed numerous fortresses in our lands in order to lower the chance of rebellion by our people. Tsarevets was one such fortress, besieged in 1393, it has been left to crumble through the ages. The church, which lies on the peak of the hill in the inner parts of the fortress, gets few visitors anymore. The town outside the Fortress has grown a lot after the fall of Bulgaria in 1396. To honor the glory of the brothers Asen and Peter, we must rebuild the fortress, from where the second life of Bulgaria began. The walls will be expanded and remade, the bridge connecting the fortress to the city will be renovated! With the help of skilled Bulgarians, Tsarevets will exceed the glory of any previous Bulgarian city!"
 FEE_Bulgaria_Events.1.a: "Rebuild Tsarevets!"

 FEE_Bulgaria_Events.1.c: "No! Put the money into the adminstrative buildings of Tarnovo!"
