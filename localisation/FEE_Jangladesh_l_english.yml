 events_jan.1.tt: "The Founding of Bikaner"
 events_jan.1.dd: "The vast, barren desert known as Jangladesh has long been divided among regional Jat clans vying for dominance over this sparse land. Throughout the latter half of the 1460s, however, this would change. The first son of Rao Jodha—the same Jodha as the one of Jodhpur in Marwar—sought to establish his own kingdom and traveled to the oasis of Bikaner. Rao Bika went on to take advantage of the disunited Jat clans and unite all of Jangladesh under his rule. He then founded the city of Bikaner, which he named after himself, and built Junagarh fort in 1478. Just ten years later, Bikaner state was formally established under the Rathore dynasty, controlling the lands for almost the next five centuries."
