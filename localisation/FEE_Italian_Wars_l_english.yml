 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.100.T: "Guerra del Gesso"
 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.100.D: "The little more than twenty-year-old King of France [FRA.Monarch.GetName], through his paternal grandmother, Maria of Anjou (1404-1463), claimed a distant hereditary right to the crown of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1492 he directed the resources of his kingdom towards the conquest of that realm, encouraged by Ludovico Sforza, called Il Moro (who was not yet Duke of Milan but was only its regent) and urged by his advisors, Guillaume Briçonnet and de Vers. \nThe reconquest of the largest kingdom of the Peninsula, already ruled by the House of Anjou (from 1282 to 1442), did not include, in the projects of [SPA.Monarch.GetName], Sicily. Through the conquest of the kingdom of Naples the king of France could have not simply increased the dominions of his House, an ambition common to many Middle-European or Anglo-Saxon ruling houses, but rather made them the starting point for those Crusades whose echo had been reinvigorated by the expulsion of the Arabs from the last Spanish possession, the Kingdom of Granada (1492). The political project of Res Publica Christiana Pro Recuperanda Terra Sancta still had a hold in the European aristocracies, even though the eight Crusades aimed at realizing it ended in disaster. The King of France himself, Louis IX, lost his life during the Eighth Crusade. Acre, the last Christian stronghold, fell definitively in 1291."

 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.102.T: "Battaglia di Fornovo"
 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.102.D: "After a few years of preparation and having secured peace treaties with his neighbours, [FRA.Monarch.GetName] departed France in August 1494 at the head of an army of around 30.000 men, including 8000 swiss mercenaries and a modern artillery park. \n[FRA.Monarch.GetName] continued his march and after sacking Pontremoli he crossed the Apennines, where he was blocked at the village of Fornovo by the assembled army of the League of Venice. The Italian army was composed mostly of condottieri hired by Venice, with only a quarter of those being Milanese as their main force was preoccupied at Novara. They were led by the Marquise of Mantova, Gianfrancesco the Second Gonzaga. \nThe Italian forces compromised mostly of heavy nights, with support from light cavalry and stradioti from the Balkans, alongside a big host of infantry and a few artillery pieces, for a total of 20.000 men lead by many nobles from the grazing lands of Romagna, such as the leaders of Bologna, Rimini, Ferrara, and Urbino. \nThe french side was around half the size of the Italian League mostly composed of armoured knights and the host of Swiss mercenaries who composed the spearhead of the army and around 40 cannons for a little over 10.000 men.\nThe battle started with an artillery duel which was swiftly won by the French. The rain slowed down the advance of the League's main forces. The attack from the Milanese knights halted the swiss formation while the stradioti instead looted the baggage train. The rest of the army was able to cross the river while others deserted the charge due to the unfavourable terrain which lead to the Italian retreat. In just an hour, the French army lost around 1000 men and the baggage train, which had around 300.000 ducats of valuables in it, while the Italians lost around 3000 to 4000 men including many commanders."

We have already tried to claim the city of Milan during the first campaign of cousin [SPA.Monarch.GetName] VIII when we occupied Novara from Ludovico Sforza, but sadly back then we failed due to the intervention of the Holy League led by Venetian and Milanese forces.

 FEE_Italian_Wars_Events.400.D: "Following the Battle of Marignano in 1515, a period of peace had been established in Europe, which, however, slowly fell apart by the beginning of 1518. Since his election to the papal throne, Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] was intent on continuing the Italian policy of the Church initiated by Julius II but in opposing ways. \nThe greatest challenge for his pontificate opened with the death of Maximilian of Habsburg in 1519 and the possible rise of the latter's grandson, [SPA.Monarch.GetName], already Burgundian Duke of the Netherlands since 1506 and King of Spain since 1516. Opposing him, presenting himself as an alternative, was [FRA.Monarch.GetName] of France, perhaps the most powerful man in Europe after the peace imposed on the Habsburgs and the Pope himself. Since the former owned Naples and the latter Milan, the election of the Emperor also became a decisive game for Italy. It was clear to Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] that whoever won would drive the other out of the peninsula and break the balance imposed by the peace of Noyon and Brussels. Control of imperial Italy, and in particular Lombardy, was, for [SPA.Monarch.GetName]' chancellor, the Italian Mercurino Arborio di Gattinara, the 'keystone' to universal monarchy, as it could link the various possessions of Flanders, Spain, Austria and, in the event, Germany. Losing it, for [FRA.Monarch.GetName], meant instead seeing France encircled by Habsburg dominions."

The truce in reality soon proved to be only apparent mainly due to the peace conditions imposed on France during the Peace of Cambrai forcing France to renounce Lombardy, and Naples and giving full dominance to Italy on the Imperial Crown hearing from their advisors \n\n\"Sire, since God has granted you the prodigious grace of elevating yourself above all the kings and princes of Christendom, to a power that only your predecessor Charlemagne had until now, you are on the path to universal monarchy, to the reunion of Christendom under one shepherd\" \n\nBut the king of France was not keen to let this happen"

Contrary to his father, however, he concentrated his sights on the northeastern borders of France rather than on Italy, which nevertheless remained an important theatre of operations.
