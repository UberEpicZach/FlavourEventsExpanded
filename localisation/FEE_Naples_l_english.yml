These measures revived the economy of the inland cities between L'Aquila and Puglia: the economic resources linked to the transhumant sheep farming of the Abruzzo Apennines were once dispersed in the Papal State, where the herds had hitherto wintered."

 FEE_Naples_Events.13.D: "The Royal Palace of Caserta, a majestic testament to opulence and grandeur, served as the epicenter of power and prestige, a beacon of civilization in the Southern Italian realm. The realm's prosperity was deeply intertwined with the delicate threads of silk, a cherished commodity coveted by monarchs and nobles alike. Silk was not merely a fabric but a symbol of luxury, a mark of regal distinction. The silkworms, nurtured in the sun-kissed lands of Naples, produced threads of exquisite quality, sought far and wide. The grandeur of the Royal Palace's halls served as a backdrop for the nobility's ceaseless pursuit of ever-more sumptuous silk. They demanded silk of the most delicate and exquisite quality, adorned with patterns that rivaled the heavens. It was a competition of vanity, where each aristocrat sought to outshine the other, their ensembles dazzling in their extravagance. In the Royal Palace of Caserta, the nobility reveled in their silken opulence, oblivious to the strain it placed on the kingdom. The noble quest for more and more silk cast a shadow over the realm, one that would eventually lead to challenges and reckonings in the grand tapestry of Naples' history. The quest for silk became a symbol of the nobility's insatiable desires, their indulgence and extravagance echoing through the annals of time."

 FEE_Naples_Events.14.T: "Manufactories?"
 FEE_Naples_Events.14.D: "In the latter half of the 17th century, the Kingdom of Naples found itself perched on the precipice of a pivotal decision regarding its cherished silk industry. The emergence of merchant capitalists and their innovative manufactories was not merely a local shift in production but a global transformation that carried far-reaching consequences. Firstly, the new means of production that these merchant capitalists championed posed a direct challenge to Naples' traditional methods. If the kingdom failed to adapt, it risked falling behind as other countries seized upon these new techniques. As the industrial revolution gathered steam, more and more nations were quick to embrace mass production, rapidly increasing their silk output. Naples, mired in tradition, faced the real danger of becoming an antiquated relic in a swiftly changing world.\n Secondly, the consequences of clinging to traditional silk production in the face of the global tide of change could be dire. While Neapolitan silk had long been celebrated for its exceptional quality, it now faced a double-edged sword. Even if it continued to produce silk of the highest caliber, it might find itself outmatched by a flood of cheaper, mass-produced silk entering the market. This influx of silk from more industrially advanced nations could lead to a glut of silk on the international market, driving down prices and undermining the economic foundation of Naples' silk industry. \nThe once-storied Neapolitan silk, renowned for its quality and craftsmanship, teetered on the brink of uncertainty. The decisions made in the coming days would define the kingdom's silk legacy and shape its future. Would Naples embrace innovation and adapt to the changing landscape of global silk production, or would it stubbornly adhere to tradition, risking its very place in the world market? The fate of Neapolitan silk hung in the balance, swaying with the winds of progress and economic survival."

 FEE_Naples_Events.15.D: "In [125.GetName], a city bathed in the golden light of the 15th century, a tale of rediscovery was poised to emerge. This noble city, under the rule of the Crown of Aragon, stood on the threshold of a new era. Here, amid the echoes of its silk-laden past, an ancient craft was rekindled. Silk, a delicate treasure from the Orient, had once held Sicily in its embrace during the Arab rule. Those were days of splendor and enchantment when [125.GetName]'s streets teemed with traders from distant lands, bearing gifts of silken marvels. The city's artisans wove intricate patterns, inspired by the exotic tales of Silk Road journeys. As the centuries unfolded, the golden age of silk slowly dimmed. However, during the rule of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the art of sericulture experienced a revival. These German monarchs recognized the allure and prosperity silk production brought. Yet, like the phases of the moon, the fate of silk waxed and waned. When the Hohenstaufen dynasty yielded its reign in Sicily, the silk industry once again dwindled. The city's reputation in silk production, once illustrious, began to fade, leaving a lingering sense of loss in its cobbled streets. \nIn the year of our Lord, [GetYear], the wise parliament of Sicily convened to debate the kingdom's destiny. Among the voices of merchants, scholars, and nobles, one man, a merchant by the name of Marco di Salvatori, stood with a vision. 'Your Graces,' he began, his voice echoing through the hallowed halls. 'Sicily was once celebrated as a realm of silk and splendor. Our ancestors, in the days of the Arab rule, wove threads of prosperity and artistry. I beseech thee, let us revive the noble craft of sericulture!' \nThe proposal was met with a chorus of murmurs. Many nobles had seen the decline of the once-flourishing trade, and skepticism lingered in the air like a morning fog. Yet, a flicker of hope glimmered in the eyes of some."

 FEE_Naples_Events.16.T: "Il baco di Messina"
 FEE_Naples_Events.16.D: "In the enchanting city of [124.GetName], a parallel tale of silk's reawakening was etching itself into the annals of history. Like a hidden treasure, [124.GetName] had long held a secret that nature itself had whispered into the soil of this coastal jewel. And now, in the year 1444, that secret was destined to shine like a lustrous pearl. Under Arab rule, [124.GetName]'s sericulture was second to none. The industrious artisans of the city spun tales of fine silk, each thread telling the story of a journey that began in the Far East and found its richest destination in [124.GetName]. The city's silken marvels graced the courts of Europe, whispering the secrets of the Silk Road to those who admired them. Yet, as dynasties changed and empires rose and fell, the echo of silken whispers in [124.GetName] started to fade. The lustrous thread of silk was gradually woven into the tapestry of history, only to be briefly rekindled by the Hohenstaufen monarchs. But like a delicate moth fluttering against the gilded cage of time, the legacy of silk slipped through the city's grasp. It was in 1444, in the grand assembly of [124.GetName], that a vision emerged. Gianluca di Contarini, a passionate merchant, stood before the council and spoke of the city's dormant treasure. 'Esteemed members,' he began, his voice resonating with conviction, 'our forefathers laid the roots of the silkworm's haven in our city. It is time for us to rekindle this legacy.'"

 FEE_Naples_Events.18.T: "Manifattura Forestiera"
 FEE_Naples_Events.18.D: "Following the establishment of the silk industry in Palermo in the 15th century, foreign craftsmen came from the major centers of Italy such as Siena, Lucca, Florence, and Milan, as well as from Seville and the Flanders to explore and work on such extravagant work. These craftsmen brought with them a wealth of skills and knowledge, which helped to elevate the quality of Sicilian silk to new heights.

 FEE_Naples_Events.19.D: "The year 1492 marked a turning point not only for Messina but also for the city of Palermo, where the ramifications of the royal decree from Spain had far-reaching consequences. In Palermo, a thriving center for silk production and a diverse cultural hub, the expulsion of the Jewish community and the dismantling of their vibrant neighborhood had profound effects on the city. The Jewish community had been an integral part of Palermo's social, economic, and cultural fabric for centuries. Their expertise in silk production, commerce, and craftsmanship had significantly contributed to the city's reputation as a silk hub.

It demanded the expulsion of the Jewish population from the island of Sicily, a decree that would echo through history. The Giudecca, once a vibrant center of Jewish life, was now marked for dissolution. Its narrow streets, bustling with artisans and merchants, bore witness to generations of Jewish culture, artistry, and commerce.

 FEE_Naples_Events.21.D: "In the latter half of the 16th century, the once-prosperous city of [124.GetName] found itself teetering on the precipice of economic decline. The silk and clothing industry, which had been the lifeblood of the city, was languishing, its fortunes waning like the ashes of Mount Etna's volcanic eruptions over Catania. Urgent action was needed to prevent the city from descending into the annals of history. The decline in trade and production posed a dire threat to [124.GetName]'s prosperity and identity. For generations, the city had been renowned for the exquisite silks and garments it produced. The very name of [124.GetName] had become synonymous with quality and craftsmanship, drawing merchants and traders from near and far.

Amidst the rubble and despair, the once-thriving silk production industry of Messina lay in ruins. The looms and workshops, which had once woven tales of artistry and craftsmanship, were now silent, their delicate threads and patterns scattered to the winds. The city's economic lifeblood, the silk trade, faced near-complete obliteration. The earthquake had brought Messina to its knees, robbing the city not only of its architectural splendor but also of its cultural and economic heritage. The intricate silk fabrics that had once adorned the nobility's wardrobes and graced international markets were now lost to the annals of history."

 FEE_Naples_Events.95.T: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo"
 FEE_Naples_Events.95.D: "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernizing the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo's government. \nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

He also commissioned a new palace for the Viceroy, which was then surrounded by buildings in square-grid streets. The Spanish Quarter, as it was called, was the first of its kind in Europe, and is still one of the most distinct areas of Naples. The express goal was to make Naples invulnerable, but it also had the side effect of making it the second largest city in Europe at the time. By his death in 1552, the legacy of the harsh ruler as a city-builder was more than secure, and Naples would continue to be a center of southern European power for centuries."

 FEE_Naples_Events.97.D: "The cave that would become the Fontanelle cemetery had for hundreds of years been used as a charnel house for old remains, which had been moved from graveyards in Naples to make space for citizens insisting on being interred near their churches.

 FEE_Naples_Events.99.T: "Ospedale L'Albergo Reale dei Poveri"
 FEE_Naples_Events.99.D: "The Albergo Reale dei Poveri was an enormous hospice for the poor in Naples from 1751. The institution was intended to not just provide care to the ill, but provide an entire self-sufficient community of the poor where they could live and work. At times its five stories would house as many as five thousand people, relieving some of the pressure poverty placed on the city of Naples. The building was designed by the famous architect Ferdinando Fuga, which was how it got its nickname \"Palazzo Fuga\"."
 FEE_Naples_Events.99.OPT1: "Let us show our people we care!"
 FEE_Naples_Events.99.OPT2: "Who can afford to spend money on the poor?"

 FEE_Naples_Events.100.T: "Francesco Solimena"
 FEE_Naples_Events.100.D: "Francesco Solimena, who lived from 1657 to 1747, was a Neapolitan painter who came to define the Baroque style in southern Italy. He trained and worked with his painter father, Angelo Solimena, and is famous for decorating churches with him, including the cathedral of Nocera. On his own, Francesco would become renown for painting frescoes in his signature dark, detailed and dramatically lit style. As Francesco's reputation grew, his atelier became a gathering point of painter students from across Naples, and he provided tutelage for many of Italy's most famous baroque painters."
 FEE_Naples_Events.100.OPT1: "He has shown us what baroque art truly can be!"
