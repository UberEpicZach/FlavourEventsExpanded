    FEE_HRE_Minors.1.tt: "Albrecht Durer"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.1.dd: "Albrecht Dürer was a painter, printmaker, and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Dürer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. He made his mark in many areas of art, but especially in his woodcuts of religious scenes, landscape paintings, and proportionality in art. He was later commemorated by the Lutheran church, and was seen as one of the foremost artists of the Northern Renaissance."
    FEE_HRE_Minors.1.a: "A true Renaissance man!"

    FEE_HRE_Minors.2.tt: "Jewish Presence in the Empire"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.2.dd: "While Jews were granted limited protection by Emperors during the 14th century, the Hussite Wars and other religious conflicts in the 15th signaled a renewed persecution of Jews throughout the Empire. Medieval attitudes that ascribed all kinds of evils to the Jewish communities intensified in many places in Germany. At the same time, they remain vital contributors to local economies. Additionally, the spread of the Renaissance and humanism has given rise to new attitudes of tolerance."
    FEE_HRE_Minors.2.a: "“Tolerance” might be worth it, if only for the money these people bring"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.2.b: "Who actually thinks we can trust them? Evict them and confiscate their wealth!"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.2.c: "Tolerance is the way of the future, let us take Jewish refugees in!"

    FEE_HRE_Minors.3.tt: "The Diet of Worms"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.3.dd: "While, initially, the preachings of Martin Luther were seen as just another local heresy to be condemned and uprooted, the explosion of pamphlets, proselytes, and protests have made the Protestant movement too large to ignore. Hoping to head off the controversy, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to convene an unofficial Diet, essentially putting Luther on trial for his beliefs. Despite his delay tactics, Luther eventually was forced to definitively say whether he would recant his beliefs or not. Famously, he responded\nwith “I neither can nor will retract anything; for it cannot be either safe or honest for a Christian to speak against his conscience. Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise; God help me! Amen”"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.3.a: "He must be condemned as a heretic"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.3.b: "Condemning him now is too risky – let him go"

    FEE_HRE_Minors.4.tt: "Johannes Gutenberg"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.4.dd: "A goldsmith, tinkerer, and inventor, Gutenberg made his mark on Western civilization by being the first to introduce the movable type printing press to Europe. Arguably the most important invention in history prior to the steam engine, the printing press single-handedly reshaped European society."
    FEE_HRE_Minors.4.a: "This man must be our advisor!"

    FEE_HRE_Minors.5.tt: "The Depression of the 16th Century"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.5.dd: "As Western Europe begins to bring wealth from the New World and open up maritime trade to the Orient, the traditional wealth of German states dried up and the states of the Empire entered a prolonged depression. The overland routes between Italy and Germany fell into disuse and the trade in north Germany fell further and further behind that of the Atlantic powers. Even the great house of the Fuggers, making loans on the basis of ongoing German prosperity, found themselves overstretched and collapsed into bankruptcy. People began to leave the onceprosperous German cities, many for the booming cities of the Low Countries. "
    FEE_HRE_Minors.5.a: "We shall recover… eventually!"

    FEE_HRE_Minors.6.tt: "Martin Luther in Hiding"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.6.dd: "Despite Luther’s ringing defense of his faith in the Bible, the Diet of Worms proclaimed him a heretic. A price was laid on his head, giving any Imperial citizen free license to kill Luther. Elector [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, was not about to let this happen. Determined to save the fledgling Reformation while he/she still could, [Root.Monarch.GetName] had him “ambushed” by masked men and spirited away to one of his castles, where no one would find him.\nLuther used the time well, translating the Bible into German directly from the original Greek, writing hymns, and coining the five key tenets of the Reformation: Sola Scriptura, Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Solus Christus, and Soli Deo Gloria. These five “Sola’s” would become the rallying cry of the reformation all over Europe."
    FEE_HRE_Minors.6.a: "God has willed it"

    FEE_HRE_Minors.7.tt: "The Question of the Imperial Navy"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.7.dd: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been defined by two things: its decentralization and independence of princes, and its focus on internal, mainly German, affairs. As such, the Empire has never had the need or the resources to develop an Imperial Navy.\nHowever, when [ROOT.GetName] began to invest its own meager resources into a competitive navy, the Emperor did not take long to take note of the development. Now, a diplomat from the Emperor’s court has arrived in [ROOT.GetName] with an interesting proposal.\nPointing out the obvious truth, the Imperial diplomat argued that, since we have invested into expensive warships, our defensive capabilities on land may be sadly lacking in comparison to our neighbors. At the same time, the Emperor has a strong land army but little in the way of a navy. If we were to join forces with the Emperor and place our navy at his disposal should he need it, he would be more than willing to protect us on land in return."
    FEE_HRE_Minors.7.a: "A splendid proposition!"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.7.b: "We are better off alone"

    FEE_HRE_Minors.8.tt: "Industrialization in the Rhineland"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.8.dd: "While Britain may have led the way in its abundance of coal, the densely-populated and resource-rich ground of the Rhineland is in an excellent position to compete. And compete we must. Our small size relative to the great European powers means we must find a niche in the emerging international market or become merely a commodity ourselves to be taken, traded, and sold to the highest bidder. The reforms necessary to bring about needed change, and the speed at which they must be done, may make some people uncomfortable, however."
    FEE_HRE_Minors.8.a: "Wealth is the only way by which small nations can have influence"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.8.b: "We must lead the way in human advancement; only then may we achieve the respect of our neighbors"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.8.c: "A nation that cannot defend itself is destined for the ash heap of history"
    FEE_HRE_Minors.8.d: "The ways of our forefathers have held true thus far; there is no pressing need"
