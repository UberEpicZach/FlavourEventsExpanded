 fee_HAB.1.t: "The Reforms of the 1495 Diet of Worms"
 fee_HAB.1.d: "The reforms presented at the Diet of Worms in 1495 was the Emperor Maximilian I's attempt at centralising the Holy Roman Empire. The most lasting of these reforms was the establishment of the Reichskammergericht, which would function as the Empire's highest court, along with an imperial ban on internal feuding, the Ewiger Landfriede.\n\nMaximilian also established an Imperial government, the \"The Reichsregiment,\" which was separate from the emperor's court. This was intended to efficiently administer the Empire as a whole, even outside of the Imperial Diet. It would representent every princedom in the Empire, but never fully managed to assume its position of power, and was dissolved already in 1502."
 fee_HAB.1.a: "We will force through the centralisation of the Empire!"
 fee_HAB.1.b: "The princedoms are pleased with the status quo."
 fee_HAB.2.t: "The Rise of the Ottomans in Europe"
 fee_HAB.2.d: "With their recent gains, there can no longer be any doubt. The Ottomans conquer everything in their way, and will stop at nothing until they have subjugated all of Christendom in the name of their heathen god. We are the bastion standing against them for the sake of Europe and of God. This is the time to reaffirm that our borders will hold strong."
 fee_HAB.2.a: "For God!"
 fee_HAB.2.b: "We have other worries, let's pursue a diplomatic path."
 fee_HAB.3.t: "The Austrian Baroque"
 fee_HAB.3.d: "While devastated by the long wars of the early 17th century, the Imperial Austria proved resilient, and the peace that followed became a time of great artistic patronage. \nWhether painting, sculpture or architecture, the Habsburgs were among the foremost patrons in the world. Over the course of a century, the already grand imperial capital of Vienna was expanded and developed, resulting in the largest baroque palaces in the world towering over peasants and kings alike. While the emperor's strict yoke went against the political development of the era, Austrian art flourished."
 fee_HAB.3.a: "Austria will be the grandest country of the Baroque!"
 fee_HAB.3.b: "Let's consider reorganising society instead."
 fee_HAB.3.tt: "Austrian art will continue to develop at a rapid pace."
 fee_HAB.4.t: "Austria Into the Future"
 fee_HAB.4.d: "As people and - more importantly - artists start to think that baroque art is beginning to be a bit much, the Austrian administration can only agree. While the Baroque has left a strong mark on the artistry of our empire, new and somewhat subtler artistic principles are forming in its wake. As we have embraced the beauty of baroque art, so we shall embrace these new ideas."
 fee_HAB.4.a: "Our greatness is far from at an end!"
 fee_HAB.5.t: "Build Beautiful Palaces"
 fee_HAB.5.d: "With the current craze for Baroque buildings, it has come to our attention that some of our current construction projects could be made even greater, more impressive and more beautiful. This would take a relatively small investment considering the grandeur and wealth it will display, and considering our position as one of the most prestigious states in the world, we cannot afford to not show off. \nYou cannot put a price on true art, so let's make the right choice, for the glory of Austria."
 fee_HAB.5.a: "Make it even more baroque!"
 fee_HAB.5.b: "Something simple will do."
 fee_HAB.6.t: "Build Beautiful Military Schools"
 fee_HAB.6.d: "With the current craze for Baroque buildings, it has come to our attention that some of our current construction projects could be made even greater, more impressive and more beautiful. This would take a relatively small investment considering the grandeur and wealth it will display, and considering our position as one of the most prestigious states in the world, we cannot afford to not show off. \nYou cannot put a price on true art, so let's make the right choice, for the glory of Austria."
 fee_HAB.6.a: "Make it even more baroque!"
 fee_HAB.6.b: "Something simple will do."
 fee_HAB.7.t: "Build Beautiful Manufactories"
 fee_HAB.7.d: "With the current craze for Baroque buildings, it has come to our attention that some of our current construction projects could be made even greater, more impressive and more beautiful. This would take a relatively small investment considering the grandeur and wealth it will display, and considering our position as one of the most prestigious states in the world, we cannot afford to not show off. \nYou cannot put a price on true art, so let's make the right choice, for the glory of Austria."

 fee_HAB.8.t: "Philip the Good requests the Lotharingian crown"
 fee_HAB.8.d: "After the death of Louis the Pious in 840 the Carolingian Empire was divided between his three sons. Two of these Kingdoms would survive to become France and the Holy Roman Empire. The third Kingdom, Lotharingia, dwindled and was upon the death of King Zwentibold absorbed into Germany. Twice during his reign Philip the Good requested from Emperor Frederick III the vacant title and crown of Lotharingia."
 fee_HAB.8.a: "Deny him the crown."
 fee_HAB.8.b: "Grant him the crown."
 fee_HAB.9.t: "Vienna captured by Matthias Corvinus."
 fee_HAB.9.d: "Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, was the nemesis of Emperor Friedrich V. They both claimed the Hungarian and Bohemian throne, they mistrusted each other, they both were eager to dominate southeastern Europe - thus saw each other as their greatest obstacle - and they were contrary characters, Friedrich patient, contemplative, fatalistic and sometimes phlegmatic, Matthias determined, ambitious and aggressive. Thus the peace concluded between Poland, Bohemia and Hungary in 1477 did not include Friedrich. The rivalry between the two, before sparked by Friedrich suspecting Matthias of secretly allowing the Ottomans to invade Austria through Hungary and supporting Wladislas Jagiello as King of Bohemia against the claims of Matthias, deteriorated into a personal feud. On the battlefield, Matthias Corvinus got the upper hand, swiftly defeated Friedrich even after he had gathered an Imperial army and invaded his hereditary lands. Within 5 years Matthias army reduced Frederick's strongholds one by one. The Emperor was deeply humiliated and his defeat evident in 1485 when Hungarian armies captured Vienna and he had to flee to Linz. In the last years of his life he was deeply depressive due to this shame. Vienna was only recaptured by his son Maximilian."
 fee_HAB.9.a: "Curses!"
 fee_HAB.10.t: "Corvinus' offer"
 fee_HAB.10.d: "Having been offered the throne by some malcontent nobles, in 1459 Friedrich III was crowned King of Hungary with the crown of St. Stephen that had been in his possession since 1440. When Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, had managed to crush the rebellious nobles and secure his diplomatic positions by reaching agreements with Jiri Podiebrad of Bohemia and the mercenary Jan Vitovec who had seized the former Cilli estates and he was about to threaten Austria, Friedrich quickly accepted a treaty in which we abandonned his claim on Hungary, but kept the title of King of Hungary, retained several border districts including the towns of Guns and Eisenstadt, was ceded the city of Sopron, received a ransom of 60000 ducats for the crown of St. Stephen and was appointed heir of Matthias in case of a childless death."
 fee_HAB.10.a: "Accept the offer"
 fee_HAB.10.b: "Press the claim on Hungary"
