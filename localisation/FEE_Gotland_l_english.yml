 FEE_Gotland_Events.1.T: "A Thing of Our Own"
 FEE_Gotland_Events.1.D: "After years of desiring self-rule, we achieved the impossible dream. Now we are also discovering that not only is it better not to be ruled by foreign warmongers, but our local administration is far more capable than they ever were!"
 FEE_Gotland_Events.1.OPT1: "Glory to Gotland!"

 FEE_Gotland_Events.2.T: "Ain't Nothing but a Gotland Thing"
 FEE_Gotland_Events.2.D: "The inhabitants of Gotland have always been suspicious of foreigners, but the island has traditionally acknowledged our god-given right to rule it. However, this time they have gone too far! They have declared their right to a Thing, a gathering of influentials that will act as the final word in matters of the law. This is clearly spitting in the face of our authority!"
 FEE_Gotland_Events.2.OPT1: "Their thing harms no one."
 FEE_Gotland_Events.2.OPT2: "Burn it to the ground and hang them all!"
