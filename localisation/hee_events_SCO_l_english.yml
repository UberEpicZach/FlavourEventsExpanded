 hee_SCO.1.t:0 "The Education Act of $YEAR$"
 hee_SCO.1.d:0 "The Education Act was a law passed by the Scottish Parliament in 1496, that required the oldest sons of every landowner to attend school to study Latin, arts and law. This was intended to improve the administration of justice across the country, by making sure local authorities understood the Scottish legal code. \nThe law text described requirements for advancing from one part of the education to another, and was in that sense an early standardised curriculum. The law was the first case of compulsory education in Scotland, and remained in force until the 19th century."
 hee_SCO.1.a:0 "Every landowner should understand our laws."
 hee_SCO.1.b:0 "Education should focus on the military."
 hee_SCO.2.t:0 "Anti-French Sentiment"
 hee_SCO.2.d:0 "Despite the great benefit of our Auld Alliance, the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ people of Scotland are worried about our cooperation with the French, one of the fiercest opponents of the reformation in Europe. What started as a whisper in town squares has become howling demands that we break our diplomatic bonds with them."
 hee_SCO.2.a:0 "Our alliance stands for a reason! The peasants can go back to their hovels and pray."
 hee_SCO.2.b:0 "It is time to let France know how important our faith is to us."
 hee_SCO.3.t:0 "The Claim of Right"
 hee_SCO.3.d:0 "In 1689, shortly after the Glorious Revolution, the Scottish Parliament passed the Claim of Right Act. The law deposed the former King James who had already been forced to cede the English throne in favour of King William III, maintaining the union of the two crowns. \nHowever, the act also expanded the power of the Scottish parliament, and ensured that any monarch of Scotland would have to accept these documents in order to legally hold the throne. If we were to force such a document upon our overlord, we could weaken their influence while retaining peace."
 hee_SCO.3.a:0 "It is better if we comply with our new [Monarch.GetTitle]’s wishes."
 hee_SCO.3.b:0 "Scotland needs to ensure its position in the new status quo."
 hee_SCO.3.b.tt:0 "Our overlord will get a chance to respond."
 hee_SCO.4.t:0 "The Scottish Present their Claim of Right"
 hee_SCO.4.d:0 "The Scottish parliament has taken the opportunity of a change of rulers to pass laws that require any [Monarch.GetTitle] to acknowledge the Scottish Parliament if they are to be seen as lawful. This leaves their Parliament in charge of many royal matters, while balancing the monarch’s rights with obligations to the country. \n\nWhile this is seems utterly unacceptable, if we were to accept the laws, [Monarch.GetTitle] [Monarch.GetName] would be the legal ruler of Scotland in every sense."
 hee_SCO.4.a:0 "I will tear their constitution to shreds!"
 hee_SCO.4.b:0 "They can do what they want, as long as they know who truly is their [Monarch.GetTitle]."
