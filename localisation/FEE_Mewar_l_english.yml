 FEE_Mewar_Events.1.T: "Erection of the Vijay Stambah"
 FEE_Mewar_Events.1.D: "To celebrate the glorious victory of our army and the capture of Sultan Mahmoud Khalji of Malwa during the Battle of Sarangpur, our esteemed Lord, [Root.Monarch.GetName], has decreed the erection of a grand Stambha (pillar) within the fortified walls of Chittor Fort. This magnificent pillar, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, will bear intricate engravings that trace the illustrious lineage of the Sisodia Clan, ensuring that our tales of conquest and the valour of our soldiers will outlive the mortal human body and echo through eternity. In a gesture of unity and respect for our Jain subjects, an icon of the Jain Goddess, Padmavati, will adorn the roof of the monument. This inclusion symbolises the harmony and respect we hold for all beliefs under our rule. This mighty Stambha will not only stand as a testament to the pride and indomitable spirit of the Rajput warriors but also as a beacon of our unyielding power. It will strike fear into the hearts of those who dare to challenge us and serve as a striking reminder to the Hindus of Mewar that as long as the Sisodias reign, not even a fly can harm them. The grand pillar will rise above Chittor Fort, a symbol of our eternal strength and the unwavering might of our dynasty, celebrating our victories and safeguarding our legacy for generations to come."
