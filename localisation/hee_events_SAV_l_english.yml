 fee_SAV.2.t: "An Army for Savoy"
 fee_SAV.2.d: "In the late 16th century, Savoy’s army went through a period of thorough modernisation. The duchy’s involvement in foreign wars and conflicts far beyond its own borders made the mercenary armies of old difficult to maintain for longer campaigns. Instead, a general army was created, a standing force that would only ever answer to the Duke of Savoy, and continually train and develop between wars, rather than be disbanded. This was how Savoy established one of Europe’s first standing armies, helping the country survive the multitude of conflicts it was involved in."
 fee_SAV.2.a: "We need a standing army."
 fee_SAV.2.b: "Mercenaries are our greatest strength."
 fee_SAV.3.t: "Emmanuel Philibert, the Ironhead"
 fee_SAV.3.d: "When Emmanuel Philibert became duke of Savoy in 1553, he was already an experienced military commander. The title was a formality, however, as the entirety of Savoy was under French occupation at the time. Instead he served the Habsburgs of Spain, as a soldier, and later as governor of the Netherlands. That was how he came to lead the Spanish invasion of northern France, where he took revenge for his lost duchy by winning a great victory. The following peace treaty restored some of Savoy to Emmanuel Philibert, who spent the next twenty years using the conflicts between France and Spain to gradually regain territory from both countries. It is thanks to his victories on the battlefield he is remembered as \"Testa di ferro\", Ironhead, but he also worked hard to internally rebuild the state apparatus that had been lost in the French conquest."
 fee_SAV.3.a: "The glory days of Savoy are yet to come."
 fee_SAV.3.b: "Truly, our army is the source of our might."
 fee_SAV.4.t: "Influences in Italy"
 fee_SAV.4.d: "Over the course of the early modern period, Savoy proved surprisingly resiliant, in no small part thanks to its strategic location combined with cunning diplomacy. By playing the forces of France and Spain against each other, Savoy prospered, and no defeat ever lasted long as the country could always count on their current oppressor’s rival to take action. Now the time has come to again consider the diplomatic landscape of Europe and choose a side."
 fee_SAV.4.a: "Side with France."
 fee_SAV.4.b: "Side with Spain."
 fee_SAV.4.c: "Savoy is stronger alone."
 fee_SAV.5.t: "Charles the Great, the Firehead"
 fee_SAV.5.d: "Ruling Savoy from 1580-1630, Charles Emmanuel is remembered as \"Testa d’feu\", Firehead, thanks to his political ambition and rashness. He aimed to expand Savoyard territory, and often started wars he struggled to finish. Regularly switching allegiance between France and Spain, he ended up having to cede more land than he gained, and he famously failed to take Genoa in a humiliating defeat that is still celebrated in that city to this day. Nevertheless, with consideration for the fact that he helped Savoy survive in what seemed an impossibly precarious situation - forming the border between French and Spanish interests in italy - Firehead is remembered as \"the Great\", a testament to the fact that his rashness and overconfidence was exactly what Savoy needed at the time."
 fee_SAV.5.a: "For Savoy!"
