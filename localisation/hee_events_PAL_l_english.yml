 hee_PAL.1.d:0 "Johann Wilhelm II was the Elector Palatine that oversaw somewhat of a restoration of the Palatinate. Under his rule, the Palatinate regained territory previously lost to France and Bavaria thanks to a number of treaties. However, the conditions of these included the demand that the Palatinate, a member state of the Holy Roman Empire with a significant portion of protestants, should not revert to protestantism. Johann Wilhelm II agreed to these demands, but instead passed laws declaring religious toleration for all citizens in the Palatinate."
 hee_PAL.1.a:0 "A man deserving of his electorate."
