 fee_PAL.1.t: "Johann Wilhelm II, Elector Palatine"
 fee_PAL.1.d: "Johann Wilhelm II was the Elector Palatine that oversaw somewhat of a restoration of the Palatinate. Under his rule, the Palatinate regained territory previously lost to France and Bavaria thanks to a number of treaties. However, the conditions of these included the demand that the Palatinate, a member state of the Holy Roman Empire with a significant portion of protestants, should not revert to protestantism. Johann Wilhelm II agreed to these demands, but instead passed laws declaring religious toleration for all citizens in the Palatinate."
 fee_PAL.1.a: "A man deserving of his electorate."
